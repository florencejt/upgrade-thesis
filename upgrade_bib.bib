	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease, with large variation in survival between patients. Currently, it remains rather difficult to predict survival based on clinical parameters alone. Here, we set out to use clinical characteristics in combination with MRI data to predict survival of ALS patients using deep learning, a machine learning technique highly effective in a broad range of big-data analyses. A group of 135 ALS patients was included from whom high-resolution diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted images were acquired at the first visit to the outpatient clinic. Next, each of the patients was monitored carefully and survival time to death was recorded. Patients were labeled as short, medium or long survivors, based on their recorded time to death as measured from the time of disease onset. In the deep learning procedure, the total group of 135 patients was split into a training set for deep learning (n = 83 patients), a validation set (n = 20) and an independent evaluation set (n = 32) to evaluate the performance of the obtained deep learning networks. Deep learning based on clinical characteristics predicted survival category correctly in 68.8\% of the cases. Deep learning based on MRI predicted 62.5\% correctly using structural connectivity and 62.5\% using brain morphology data. Notably, when we combined the three sources of information, deep learning prediction accuracy increased to 84.4\%. Taken together, our findings show the added value of MRI with respect to predicting survival in ALS, demonstrating the advantage of deep learning in disease prognostication.},

	abstract = {Objective
It is essential to develop predictive algorithms for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) disease progression to allow for efficient clinical trials and patient care. The best existing predictive models rely on several months of baseline data and have only been validated in clinical trial research datasets. We asked whether a model developed using clinical research patient data could be applied to the broader ALS population typically seen at a tertiary care ALS clinic.

Methods
Based on the PRO-ACT ALS database, we developed random forest (RF), pre-slope, and generalized linear (GLM) models to test whether accurate, unbiased models could be created using only baseline data. Secondly, we tested whether a model could be validated with a clinical patient dataset to demonstrate broader applicability.

Results
We found that a random forest model using only baseline data could accurately predict disease progression for a clinical trial research dataset as well as a population of patients being treated at a tertiary care clinic. The RF Model outperformed a pre-slope model and was similar to a GLM model in terms of root mean square deviation at early time points. At later time points, the RF Model was far superior to either model. Finally, we found that only the RF Model was unbiased and was less subject to overfitting than either of the other two models when applied to a clinic population.

Interpretation
We conclude that the RF Model delivers superior predictions of ALS disease progression.},

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease and the most common neurodegenerative disorder of young adults. ALS patients present a rapidly progressive motor weakness. This usually leads to death in a few years by respiratory failure. The correct prediction of respiratory insufficiency is thus key for patient management. In this context, we propose an innovative approach for prognostic prediction based on patient snapshots and time windows. We first cluster temporally-related tests to obtain snapshots of the patients condition at a given time (patient snapshots). Then we use the snapshots to predict the probability of an ALS patient to require assisted ventilation after k days from the time of clinical evaluation (time window). This probability is based on the patients current condition, evaluated using clinical features, including functional impairment assessments and a complete set of respiratory tests. The prognostic models include three temporal windows allowing to perform short, medium and long term prognosis regarding progression to assisted ventilation. Experimental results show an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in the test set of approximately 79\% for time windows of 90, 180 and 365days. Creating patient snapshots using hierarchical clustering with constraints outperforms the state of the art, and the proposed prognostic model becomes the first non population-based approach for prognostic prediction in ALS. The results are promising and should enhance the current clinical practice, largely supported by non-standardized tests and clinicians experience.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a rapid motor decline, leading to respiratory failure and subsequently to death. In this context, researchers have sought for models to automatically predict disease progression to assisted ventilation in ALS patients. However, the clinical translation of such models is limited by the lack of insight 1) on the risk of error for predictions at patient-level, and 2) on the most adequate time to administer the non-invasive ventilation. To address these issues, we combine Conformal Prediction (a machine learning framework that complements predictions with confidence measures) and a mixture experts into a prognostic model which not only predicts whether an ALS patient will suffer from respiratory insufficiency but also the most likely time window of occurrence, at a given reliability level. Promising results were obtained, with near 80\% of predictions being correctly identified.},

	abstract = {Background: better predictors of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis disease course could enable smaller and more targeted clinical trials. Partially to address this aim, the Prize for Life foundation collected de-identified records from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis sufferers who participated in clinical trials of investigational drugs and made them available to researchers in the PRO-ACT database.    Methods: in this study, time series data from PRO-ACT subjects were fitted to exponential models. Binary classes for decline in the total score of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R) (fast/slow progression) and survival (high/low death risk) were derived. Data was segregated into training and test sets via cross validation. Learning algorithms were applied to the demographic, clinical and laboratory parameters in the training set to predict ALSFRS-R decline and the derived fast/slow progression and high/low death risk categories. The performance of predictive models was assessed by cross-validation in the test set using Receiver Operator Curves and root mean squared errors.  Results: a model created using a boosting algorithm containing the decline in four parameters (weight, alkaline phosphatase, albumin and creatine kinase) post baseline, was able to predict functional decline class (fast or slow) with fair accuracy (AUC=0.82).  However similar approaches to build a predictive model for decline class by baseline subject characteristics were not successful.  In contrast, baseline values of total bilirubin, gamma glutamyltransferase, urine specific gravity and ALSFRS-R item score - climbing stairs were sufficient to predict survival class.   Conclusions: using combinations of small numbers of variables it was possible to predict classes of functional decline and survival across the 1-2 year timeframe available in PRO-ACT. These findings may have utility for design of future ALS clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Summary  Background  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive, fatal motor neuron disease with a variable natural history. There are no accurate models that predict the disease course and outcomes, which complicates risk assessment and counselling for individual patients, stratification of patients for trials, and timing of interventions. We therefore aimed to develop and validate a model for predicting a composite survival endpoint for individual patients with ALS.  Methods  We obtained data for patients from 14 specialised ALS centres (each one designated as a cohort) in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. All patients were diagnosed in the centres after excluding other diagnoses and classified according to revised El Escorial criteria. We assessed 16 patient characteristics as potential predictors of a composite survival outcome (time between onset of symptoms and non-invasive ventilation for more than 23 h per day, tracheostomy, or death) and applied backward elimination with bootstrapping in the largest population-based dataset for predictor selection. Data were gathered on the day of diagnosis or as soon as possible thereafter. Predictors that were selected in more than 70\% of the bootstrap resamples were used to develop a multivariable Royston-Parmar model for predicting the composite survival outcome in individual patients. We assessed the generalisability of the model by estimating heterogeneity of predictive accuracy across external populations (ie, populations not used to develop the model) using internal–external cross-validation, and quantified the discrimination using the concordance ( c ) statistic (area under the receiver operator characteristic curve) and calibration using a calibration slope.  Findings  Data were collected between Jan 1, 1992, and Sept 22, 2016 (the largest data-set included data from 1936 patients). The median follow-up time was 97·5 months (IQR 52·9–168·5). Eight candidate predictors entered the prediction model: bulbar versus non-bulbar onset (univariable hazard ratio [HR] 1·71, 95\% CI 1·63–1·79), age at onset (1·03, 1·03–1·03), definite versus probable or possible ALS (1·47, 1·39–1·55), diagnostic delay (0·52, 0·51–0·53), forced vital capacity (HR 0·99, 0·99–0·99), progression rate (6·33, 5·92–6·76), frontotemporal dementia (1·34, 1·20–1·50), and presence of a  C9orf72  repeat expansion (1·45, 1·31–1·61), all p c  statistic for external predictive accuracy of the model was 0·78 (95\% CI 0·77–0·80; 95\% prediction interval [PI] 0·74–0·82) and the calibration slope was 1·01 (95\% CI 0·95–1·07; 95\% PI 0·83–1·18). The model was used to define five groups with distinct median predicted (SE) and observed (SE) times in months from symptom onset to the composite survival outcome: very short 17·7 (0·20), 16·5 (0·23); short 25·3 (0·06), 25·2 (0·35); intermediate 32·2 (0·09), 32·8 (0·46); long 43·7 (0·21), 44·6 (0·74); and very long 91·0 (1·84), 85·6 (1·96).  Interpretation  We have developed an externally validated model to predict survival without tracheostomy and non-invasive ventilation for more than 23 h per day in European patients with ALS. This model could be applied to individualised patient management, counselling, and future trial design, but to maximise the benefit and prevent harm it is intended to be used by medical doctors only.

First, we train NormVAE on the neuroimaging data of healthy population. Next, we assess the trained model on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients to estimate how each disease patient deviated from the norm and identified the brain regions associated with the deviations. Our experiments demonstrated that the NormVAE-generated patient-level deviation maps exhibit increased sensitivity to the different progression stages of AD and have a better correlation with cognition compared to baseline normative models like Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and a standard VAE, which generates deterministic subject-level deviations without any uncertainty estimates.},

However, modeling complex interaction dynamics and capturing the possibility of many possible outcomes in such interactive settings is very challenging, which has recently prompted the study of several different approaches. In this work, we provide a self-contained tutorial on a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach to human behavior prediction which, at its core, can produce a multimodal probability distribution over future human trajectories conditioned on past interactions and candidate robot future actions. Specifically, the goals of this tutorial paper are to review and build a taxonomy of state-of-the-art methods in human behavior prediction, from physics-based to purely data-driven methods, provide a rigorous yet easily accessible description of a data-driven, CVAE-based approach, highlight important design characteristics that make this an attractive model to use in the context of model-based planning for human-robot interactions, and provide important design considerations when using this class of models.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Background{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is known to represent a collection of overlapping syndromes. Various classification systems based on empirical observations have been proposed, but it is unclear to what extent they reflect ALS population substructures. We aimed to use machine-learning techniques to identify the number and nature of ALS subtypes to obtain a better understanding of this heterogeneity, enhance our understanding of the disease, and improve clinical care. {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} In this retrospective study, we applied unsupervised Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection [UMAP]) modelling, semi-supervised (neural network UMAP) modelling, and supervised (ensemble learning based on LightGBM) modelling to a population-based discovery cohort of patients who were diagnosed with ALS while living in the Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta regions of Italy, for whom detailed clinical data, such as age at symptom onset, were available. We excluded patients with missing Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) feature values from the unsupervised and semi-supervised steps. We replicated our findings in an independent population-based cohort of patients who were diagnosed with ALS while living in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy. {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2015, 2858 patients were entered in the discovery cohort. After excluding 497 (17\%) patients with missing ALSFRS-R feature values, data for 42 clinical features across 2361 (83\%) patients were available for the unsupervised and semi-supervised analysis. We found that semi-supervised machine learning produced the optimum clustering of the patients with ALS. These clusters roughly corresponded to the six clinical subtypes defined by the Chiò classification system (ie, bulbar, respiratory, flail arm, classical, pyramidal, and flail leg ALS). Between Jan 1, 2009, and March 1, 2018, 1097 patients were entered in the replication cohort. After excluding 108 (10\%) patients with missing ALSFRS-R feature values, data for 42 clinical features across 989 patients were available for the unsupervised and semi-supervised analysis. All 1097 patients were included in the supervised analysis. The same clusters were identified in the replication cohort. By contrast, other ALS classification schemes, such as the El Escorial categories, Milano-Torino clinical staging, and King's clinical stages, did not adequately label the clusters. Supervised learning identified 11 clinical parameters that predicted ALS clinical subtypes with high accuracy (area under the curve 0·982 [95\% CI 0·980–0·983]). {\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} Our data-driven study provides insight into the ALS population substructure and confirms that the Chiò classification system successfully identifies ALS subtypes. Additional validation is required to determine the accuracy and clinical use of these algorithms in assigning clinical subtypes. Nevertheless, our algorithms offer a broad insight into the clinical heterogeneity of ALS and help to determine the actual subtypes of disease that exist within this fatal neurodegenerative syndrome.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Interventional trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) suffer from the heterogeneity of the disease as it considerably reduces statistical power. We asked if blood neurofilament light chains (NfL) could be used to anticipate disease progression and increase trial power. METHODS In 125 patients with ALS from three independent prospective studies-one observational study and two interventional trials-we developed and externally validated a multivariate linear model for predicting disease progression, measured by the monthly decrease of the ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R) score. We trained the prediction model in the observational study and tested the predictive value of the following parameters assessed at diagnosis: NfL levels, sex, age, site of onset, body mass index, disease duration, ALSFRS-R score, and monthly ALSFRS-R score decrease since disease onset. We then applied the resulting model in the other two study cohorts to assess the actual utility for interventional trials. We analyzed the impact on trial power in mixed-effects models and compared the performance of the NfL model with two currently used predictive approaches, which anticipate disease progression using the ALSFRS-R decrease during a three-month observational period (lead-in) or since disease onset (ΔFRS). RESULTS Among the parameters provided, the NfL levels (P{\textless}0.001) and the interaction with site of onset (P{\textless}0.01) contributed significantly to the prediction, forming a robust NfL prediction model (R=0.67). Model application in the trial cohorts confirmed its applicability and revealed superiority over lead-in and ΔFRS-based approaches. The NfL model improved statistical power by 61\% and 22\% (95\% confidence intervals: 54\%-66\%, 7\%-29\%). CONCLUSION The use of the NfL-based prediction model to compensate for clinical heterogeneity in ALS could significantly increase the trial power.

Artificial intelligence (AI) with machine learning (ML) methods offers unprecedented opportunities to construct accurate prognosis and diagnostic models. Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) dataset is the largest public ALS clinical trial data that various researches were accomplished on this framework with ML approach. In this chapter, we study the causal analysis of ALS with AI perspective, and also ML methods for predicting the evolution of ALS will be explained on the PRO-ACT dataset.

	doi = {10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103895},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND The progression of many degenerative diseases is tracked periodically using scales evaluating functionality in daily activities. Although estimating the timing of critical events (i.e., disease tollgates) during degenerative disease progression is desirable, the necessary data may not be readily available in scale records. Further, analysis of disease progression poses data challenges, such as censoring and misclassification errors, which need to be addressed to provide meaningful research findings and inform patients. METHODS We developed a novel binary classification approach to map scale scores into disease tollgates to describe disease progression leveraging standard/modified Kaplan-Meier analyses. The approach is demonstrated by estimating progression pathways in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Tollgate-based ALS Staging System (TASS) specifies the critical events (i.e., tollgates) in ALS progression. We first developed a binary classification predicting whether each TASS tollgate was passed given the itemized ALSFRS-R scores using 514 ALS patients' data from Mayo Clinic-Rochester. Then, we utilized the binary classification to translate/map the ALSFRS-R data of 3,264 patients from the PRO-ACT database into TASS. We derived the time trajectories of ALS progression through tollgates from the augmented PRO-ACT data using Kaplan-Meier analyses. The effects of misclassification errors, condition-dependent dropouts, and censored data in trajectory estimations were evaluated with Interval Censored Kaplan Meier Analysis and Multistate Model for Panel Data. RESULTS The approach using Mayo Clinic data accurately estimated tollgate-passed states of patients given their itemized ALSFRS-R scores (AUCs{\textgreater}0.90). The tollgate time trajectories derived from the augmented PRO-ACT dataset provide valuable insights; we predicted that the majority of the ALS patients would have modified arm function (67\%) and require assistive devices for walking (53\%) by the second year after ALS onset. By the third year, most (74\%) ALS patients would occasionally use a wheelchair, while 48\% of the ALS patients would be wheelchair-dependent by the fourth year. Assistive speech devices and feeding tubes were needed in 49\% and 30\% of the patients by the third year after ALS onset, respectively. The onset body region alters some tollgate passage time estimations by 1-2 years. CONCLUSIONS The estimated tollgate-based time trajectories inform patients and clinicians about prospective assistive device needs and life changes. More research is needed to personalize these estimations according to prognostic factors. Further, the approach can be leveraged in the progression of other diseases.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40035-021-00255-0},
	abstract = {Objective  There is increasing evidence that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease impacting large-scale brain networks. However, it is still unclear which structural networks are associated with the disease and whether the network connectomics are associated with disease progression. This study was aimed to characterize the network abnormalities in ALS and to identify the network-based biomarkers that predict the ALS baseline progression rate.  Methods  Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 73 patients with sporadic ALS and 100 healthy participants to acquire diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and construct white matter (WM) networks using tractography methods. The global and regional network properties were compared between ALS and healthy subjects. The single-subject WM network matrices of patients were used to predict the ALS baseline progression rate using machine learning algorithms.  Results  Compared with the healthy participants, the patients with ALS showed significantly decreased clustering coefficient Cp (P = 0.0034, t = 2.98), normalized clustering coefficient γ (P = 0.039, t = 2.08), and small-worldness σ (P = 0.038, t = 2.10) at the global network level. The patients also showed decreased regional centralities in motor and non-motor systems including the frontal, temporal and subcortical regions. Using the single-subject structural connection matrix, our classification model could distinguish patients with fast versus slow progression rate with an average accuracy of 85\%.  Conclusion  Disruption of the WM structural networks in ALS is indicated by weaker small-worldness and disturbances in regions outside of the motor systems, extending the classical pathophysiological understanding of ALS as a motor disorder. The individual WM structural network matrices of ALS patients are potential neuroimaging biomarkers for the baseline disease progression in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {For multimodal representation learning, traditional black-box approaches often fall short of extracting interpretable multilayer hidden structures, which contribute to visualize the connections between different modalities at multiple semantic levels. To extract interpretable multimodal latent representations and visualize the hierarchial semantic relationships between different modalities, based on deep topic models, we develop a novel multimodal Poisson gamma belief network (mPGBN) that tightly couples the observations of different modalities via imposing sparse connections between their modality-specific hidden layers. To alleviate the time-consuming Gibbs sampler adopted by traditional topic models in the testing stage, we construct a Weibull-based variational inference network (encoder) to directly map the observations to their latent representations, and further combine it with the mPGBN (decoder), resulting in a novel multimodal Weibull variational autoencoder (MWVAE), which is fast in out-of-sample prediction and can handle large-scale multimodal datasets. Qualitative evaluations on bimodal data consisting of image-text pairs show that the developed MWVAE can successfully extract expressive multimodal latent representations for downstream tasks like missing modality imputation and multimodal retrieval. Further extensive quantitative results demonstrate that both MWVAE and its supervised extension sMWVAE achieve state-of-the-art performance on various multimodal benchmarks.},

	abstract = {Central precocious puberty (CPP) is the most common type of precocious puberty and has a significant effect on children. A gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulation test is the gold standard for confirming CPP. This test, however, is costly and unpleasant for patients. Therefore, it is critical to developing alternative methods for CPP diagnosis in order to alleviate patient suffering. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system for predicting response to the GnRH-stimulation test using data from laboratory tests, electronic health records (EHRs), and pelvic ultrasonography and left-hand radiography reports. The challenges are in integrating these mul-timodal features into a comprehensive deep learning model in order to achieve an accurate diagnosis while also accounting for the missing or incomplete modalities. To begin, we developed a dynamic multimodal variational autoencoder (DMVAE) that can exploit intrinsic correlations between different modalities to im-pute features for missing modalities. Next, we combined features from all modalities to predict the outcome of a CPP diagnosis. The experimental results (AUROC 0.9086) demonstrate that our DMVAE model is superior to standard methods. Additionally, we showed that by setting appropriate operating thresholds, clinicians could diagnose about two-thirds of patients with confidence (1.0 specificity). Only about one-third of patients require confirmation of their diagnoses using GnRH (or GnRH analog)-stimulation tests. To interpret the results, we implemented an explainer Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to analyze the local and global feature attributions.},

	abstract = {Prior work on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has demonstrated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can leverage the high-dimensional image information for diagnosing patients. Beside such data-driven approaches, many established biomarkers exist and are typically represented as tabular data, such as demographics, genetic alterations, or laboratory measurements from cerebrospinal fluid. However, little research has focused on the effective integration of tabular data into existing CNN architectures to improve patient diagnosis. We introduce the Dynamic Affine Feature Map Transform (DAFT), a general-purpose module for CNNs that incites or represses high-level concepts learned from a 3D image by conditioning feature maps of a convolutional layer on both a patient’s image and tabular clinical information. This is achieved by using an auxiliary neural network that outputs a scaling factor and offset to dynamically apply an affine transformation to the feature maps of a convolutional layer. In our experiments on AD diagnosis and time-to-dementia prediction, we show that the DAFT is highly effective in combining 3D image and tabular information by achieving a mean balanced accuracy of 0.622 for diagnosis, and mean c-index of 0.748 for time-to-dementia prediction, thus outperforming all baseline methods. Finally, our extensive ablation study and empirical experiments reveal that the performance improvement due to the DAFT is robust with respect to many design choices.},

	abstract = {Objective To understand the progressive nature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by investigating differential brain patterns of gray and white matter involvement in clinically or genetically defined subgroups of patients using cross-sectional, longitudinal, and multimodal MRI.
Methods We assessed cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, and white matter connectivity from T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI in 292 patients with ALS (follow-up: n = 150) and 156 controls (follow-up: n = 72). Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess changes in structural brain measurements over time in patients compared to controls.
Results Patients with a C9orf72 mutation (n = 24) showed widespread gray and white matter involvement at baseline, and extensive loss of white matter integrity in the connectome over time. In C9orf72-negative patients, we detected cortical thinning of motor and frontotemporal regions, and loss of white matter integrity of connections linked to the motor cortex. Patients with spinal onset displayed widespread white matter involvement at baseline and gray matter atrophy over time, whereas patients with bulbar onset started out with prominent gray matter involvement. Patients with unaffected cognition or behavior displayed predominantly motor system involvement, while widespread cerebral changes, including frontotemporal regions with progressive white matter involvement over time, were associated with impaired behavior or cognition. Progressive loss of gray and white matter integrity typically occurred in patients with shorter disease durations ({\textless}13 months), independent of progression rate.
Conclusions Heterogeneity of phenotype and C9orf72 genotype relates to distinct patterns of cerebral degeneration. We demonstrate that imaging studies have the potential to monitor disease progression and early intervention may be required to limit cerebral degeneration.},

	abstract = {Background The underlying neuropathological process of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be classified in a four-stage sequential pTDP-43 cerebral propagation scheme. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), in vivo imaging of these stages has already been shown to be feasible for the specific corticoefferent tract systems. Because both cognitive and oculomotor dysfunctions are associated with microstructural changes at the brain level in ALS, a cognitive and an oculomotor staging classification were developed, respectively. The association of these different in vivo staging schemes has not been attempted to date. Methods A total of 245 patients with ALS underwent DTI, video-oculography, and cognitive testing using Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS). A set of tract-related diffusion metrics, cognitive, and oculomotor parameters was selected for further analysis. Hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms were used to obtain an optimal cluster solution. Results According to cluster analysis, differentiation of patients with ALS into four clusters resulted: Cluster A showed the highest fractional anisotropy (FA) values and thereby the best performances in executive oculomotor tasks and cognitive tests, whereas cluster D showed the lowest FA values, the lowest ECAS scores, and the worst executive oculomotor performance across all clusters. Clusters B and C showed intermediate results regarding parameter values. Discussion In a multimodal dataset of technical assessments of brain structure and function in ALS, an artificial intelligence-based cluster analysis showed high congruence of DTI, executive oculomotor function, and neuropsychological performance for mapping in vivo correlates of neuropathological spreading.},

	abstract = {Multi-modal data abounds in biomedicine, such as radiology images and reports. Interpreting this data at scale is essential for improving clinical care and accelerating clinical research. Biomedical text with its complex semantics poses additional challenges in vision--language modelling compared to the general domain, and previous work has used insufficiently adapted models that lack domain-specific language understanding. In this paper, we show that principled textual semantic modelling can substantially improve contrastive learning in self-supervised vision--language processing. We release a language model that achieves state-of-the-art results in radiology natural language inference through its improved vocabulary and novel language pretraining objective leveraging semantics and discourse characteristics in radiology reports. Further, we propose a self-supervised joint vision--language approach with a focus on better text modelling. It establishes new state of the art results on a wide range of publicly available benchmarks, in part by leveraging our new domain-specific language model. We release a new dataset with locally-aligned phrase grounding annotations by radiologists to facilitate the study of complex semantic modelling in biomedical vision--language processing. A broad evaluation, including on this new dataset, shows that our contrastive learning approach, aided by textual-semantic modelling, outperforms prior methods in segmentation tasks, despite only using a global-alignment objective.},

	abstract = {Background and purpose Assessing survival is a critical issue in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Neuroimaging seems to be promising in the assessment of disease severity and several studies also suggest a strong relationship between spinal cord (SC) atrophy described by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and disease progression. The aim of the study was to determine the predictive added value of multimodal SC MRI on survival. Methods Forty-nine ALS patients were recruited and clinical data were collected. Patients were scored on the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale and manual muscle testing. They were followed longitudinally to assess survival. The cervical SC was imaged using the 3 T MRI system. Cord volume and cross-sectional area (CSA) at each vertebral level were computed. Diffusion tensor imaging metrics were measured. Imaging metrics and clinical variables were used as inputs for a multivariate Cox regression survival model. Results On building a multivariate Cox regression model with clinical and MRI parameters, fractional anisotropy, magnetization transfer ratio and CSA at C2–C3, C4–C5, C5–C6 and C6–C7 vertebral levels were significant. Moreover, the hazard ratio calculated for CSA at the C3–C4 and C5–C6 levels indicated an increased risk for patients with SC atrophy (respectively 0.66 and 0.68). In our cohort, MRI parameters seem to be more predictive than clinical variables, which had a hazard ratio very close to 1. Conclusions It is suggested that multimodal SC MRI could be a useful tool in survival prediction especially if used at the beginning of the disease and when combined with clinical variables. To validate it as a biomarker, confirmation of the results in bigvalger independent cohorts of patients is warranted.},

	abstract = {Objective: To test blood and CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in relation to disease progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Methods: Using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, NfL levels were measured in samples from 2 cohorts of patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls, recruited in London (ALS/control, plasma: n 5 103/42) and Oxford (ALS/control, serum: n 5 64/36; paired CSF: n 5 38/20). NfL levels in patients were measured at regular intervals for up to 3 years. Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised score was used to assess disease progression. Survival was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis.
Results: CSF, serum, and plasma NfL discriminated patients with ALS from healthy controls with high sensitivity (97\%, 89\%, 90\%, respectively) and specificity (95\%, 75\%, 71\%, respectively). CSF NfL was highly correlated with serum levels (r 5 0.78, p , 0.0001). Blood NfL levels were approximately 4 times as high in patients with ALS compared with controls in both cohorts, and maintained a relatively constant expression during follow-up. Blood NfL levels at recruitment were strong, independent predictors of survival. The highest tertile of blood NfL at baseline had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.91 (95\% confidence interval 1.98–7.94, p , 0.001).
Conclusion: Blood-derived NfL level is an easily accessible biomarker with prognostic value in ALS. The individually relatively stable levels longitudinally offer potential for NfL as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in future therapeutic trials.},

	abstract = {Objective
To identify preferred neurofilament assays and clinically validate serum neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) as prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) therapy development.

Methods
In this prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n = 229), primary lateral sclerosis (n = 20), and progressive muscular atrophy (n = 11), biological specimens were collected, processed, and stored according to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs). Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations.

Results
For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, there were no missing data (i.e., technical replicates below the lower limit of detection were not encountered). For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in ∼4\% and ∼10\% of serum samples, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation for NfL in serum and CSF were both ∼3\%. Mean coefficients of variation for pNfH in serum and CSF were ∼4\%–5\% and ∼2\%–3\%, respectively, in all assays. Baseline serum NfL concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) slope and survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of ∼8\%. Depending on the method used to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size savings.

Conclusions
Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker for ALS. Serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH), quantified using the Simoa assay, has potential utility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of treatment effect.},

	abstract = {Objective
To employ Artificial Intelligence to model, predict and simulate the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression over time in terms of variable interactions, functional impairments, and survival.

Methods
We employed demographic and clinical variables, including functional scores and the utilisation of support interventions, of 3940 ALS patients from four Italian and two Israeli registers to develop a new approach based on Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) that models the ALS evolution over time, in two distinct scenarios of variable availability. The method allows to simulate patients’ disease trajectories and predict the probability of functional impairment and survival at different time points.

Results
DBNs explicitly represent the relationships between the variables and the pathways along which they influence the disease progression. Several notable inter-dependencies were identified and validated by comparison with literature. Moreover, the implemented tool allows the assessment of the effect of different markers on the disease course, reproducing the probabilistically expected clinical progressions. The tool shows high concordance in terms of predicted and real prognosis, assessed as time to functional impairments and survival (integral of the AU-ROC in the first 36 months between 0.80–0.93 and 0.84–0.89 for the two scenarios, respectively).

Conclusions
Provided only with measurements commonly collected during the first visit, our models can predict time to the loss of independence in walking, breathing, swallowing, communicating, and survival and it can be used to generate in silico patient cohorts with specific characteristics. Our tool provides a comprehensive framework to support physicians in treatment planning and clinical decision-making.

	abstract = {Clinical decision-making in oncology involves multimodal data such as radiology scans, molecular profiling, histopathology slides, and clinical factors. Despite the importance of these modalities individually, no deep learning framework to date has combined them all to predict patient prognosis. Here, we predict the overall survival (OS) of glioma patients from diverse multimodal data with a Deep Orthogonal Fusion (DOF) model. The model learns to combine information from multiparametric MRI exams, biopsy-based modalities (such as H\&E slide images and/or DNA sequencing), and clinical variables into a comprehensive multimodal risk score. Prognostic embeddings from each modality are learned and combined via attention-gated tensor fusion. To maximize the information gleaned from each modality, we introduce a multimodal orthogonalization (MMO) loss term that increases model performance by incentivizing constituent embeddings to be more complementary. DOF predicts OS in glioma patients with a median C-index of 0.788 +/- 0.067, significantly outperforming (p=0.023) the best performing unimodal model with a median C-index of 0.718 +/- 0.064.

However, deep learning approaches applied for classifying medical images do not adhere to this architecture as they rely on several pre- and post-processing steps. This shortcoming can be explained by the relatively small number of available labeled subjects, the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, and difficulties in interpreting the results of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple 3D Convolutional Neural Networks and exploit its model parameters to tailor the end-to-end architecture for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our model can diagnose AD with an accuracy of 94.1\% on the popular ADNI dataset using only MRI data, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art. Based on the learned model, we identify the disease biomarkers, the results of which were in accordance with the literature. We further transfer the learned model to diagnose mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD, which yield better results compared to other methods.},

	abstract = {In the field of computer-aided Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, jointly identifying brain diseases and predicting clinical scores using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have attracted increasing attention since these two tasks are highly correlated. Most of existing joint learning approaches require hand-crafted feature representations for MR images. Since hand-crafted features of MRI and classification/regression models may not coordinate well with each other, conventional methods may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also be related to brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic performance. However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate such demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we propose a deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM2L) framework for simultaneous brain disease classification and clinical score regression, using MRI data and demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we first identify the discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then extract multiple image patches around these detected landmarks. We then propose a deep multi-task multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint classification and regression. Our DM2L framework can not only automatically learn discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate the demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We evaluate the proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with 1984 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that DM2 L is superior to several state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.},

	abstract = {As machine learning and artificial intelligence are more frequently being leveraged to tackle problems in the health sector, there has been increased interest in utilizing them in clinical decision-support. This has historically been the case in single modal data such as electronic health record data. Attempts to improve prediction and resemble the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making this has been met in the computational field of machine learning by a fusion of disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. We used a combination of content analysis and literature searches to establish search strings and databases of PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 125 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. However, there exist a wide breadth of current applications. The most common form of information fusion was early fusion. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance performing heterogeneous data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies and pursuit of FDA-approved tools. These findings provide a map of the current literature on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.},

Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data sources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver more accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of applications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI systems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data pre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted for research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM framework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on HAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N = 34,537 samples) containing 7279 unique hospitalizations and 6485 patients, spanning all possible input combinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and images), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this framework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar single-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6–33\%), including 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and 48 h mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each modality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the heterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal inputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties and flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a promising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and operational healthcare settings.},

The current state-of-the-art deep learning models for radiology applications consider only pixel-value information without data informing clinical context. Yet in practice, pertinent and accurate non-imaging data based on the clinical history and laboratory data enable physicians to interpret imaging findings in the appropriate clinical context, leading to a higher diagnostic accuracy, informative clinical decision making, and improved patient outcomes. To achieve a similar goal using deep learning, medical imaging pixel-based models must also achieve the capability to process contextual data from electronic health records (EHR) in addition to pixel data. In this paper, we describe different data fusion techniques that can be applied to combine medical imaging with EHR, and systematically review medical data fusion literature published between 2012 and 2020. We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus for original research articles leveraging deep learning for fusion of multimodality data. In total, we screened 985 studies and extracted data from 17 papers. By means of this systematic review, we present current knowledge, summarize important results and provide implementation guidelines to serve as a reference for researchers interested in the application of multimodal fusion in medical imaging.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies often collect multimodal data. These modalities contain both shared and mutually exclusive information about the brain. This work aims to find a scalable and interpretable method to fuse the information of multiple neuroimaging modalities into a lower-dimensional latent space using a variational autoencoder (VAE). To assess whether the encoder-decoder pair retains meaningful information, this work evaluates the representations using a schizophrenia classification task. The linear classifier, trained on the representations obtained through dimensionality reduction, achieves an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) of 0.8609. Thus, training on a multimodal dataset with functional brain networks and a structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) scan, leads to dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The proposed dimensionality reduction outperforms both early and late fusion principal component analysis on the classification task.Clinical relevance — This work examines the interplay between neuroimaging modalities and their relation to mental disorders. This allows for more complex and rigorous analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data throughout clinical settings.},

Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are powerful generative models that learn representations of complex data. The flexibility of VAE may come at the expense of lack of interpretability in describing the joint relationship between heterogeneous data. To tackle this problem, in this work we extend the variational framework of VAE to bring parsimony and interpretability when jointly account for latent relationships across multiple channels. In the latent space, this is achieved by constraining the variational distribution of each channel to a common target prior. Parsimonious latent representations are enforced by variational dropout. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model correctly identifies the prescribed latent dimensions and data relationships across multiple testing scenarios. When applied to imaging and clinical data, our method allows to identify the joint effect of age and pathology in describing clinical condition in a large scale clinical cohort.},

Advances in technologies produced high-dimensional data of different modalities including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Understanding the complex association patterns among these heterogeneous and complementary data is of benefit to the diagnosis and prevention of AD. In this paper, we apply the appropriate correlation analysis method to detect the relationships between brain regions and genes, and propose “brain region-gene pairs” as the multimodal features of the sample. In addition, we put forward a novel data analysis method from technology aspect, cluster evolutionary random forest (CERF), which is suitable for “brain region-gene pairs”. The idea of clustering evolution is introduced to improve the generalization performance of random forest which is constructed by randomly selecting samples and sample features. Through hierarchical clustering of decision trees in random forest, the decision trees with higher similarity are clustered into one class, and the decision trees with the best performance are retained to enhance the diversity between decision trees. Furthermore, based on CERF, we integrate feature construction, feature selection and sample classification to find the optimal combination of different methods, and design a comprehensive diagnostic framework for AD. The framework is validated by the samples with both fMRI and SNP data from ADNI. The results show that we can effectively identify AD patients and discover some brain regions and genes associated with AD significantly based on this framework. These findings are conducive to the clinical treatment and prevention of AD.},

	abstract = {The social and financial costs associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) result in significant burdens on our society. In order to understand the causes of this disease, public-private partnerships such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) release data into the scientific community. These data are organized into various modalities (genetic, brain-imaging, cognitive scores, diagnoses, etc.) for analysis. Many statistical learning approaches used in medical image analysis do not explicitly take advantage of this multimodal data structure. In this work we propose a novel objective function and optimization algorithm that is designed to handle multimodal information for the prediction and analysis of AD. Our approach relies on robust matrix-factorization and row-wise sparsity provided by the ℓ2,1- norm in order to integrate multimodal data provided by the ADNI. These techniques are jointly optimized with a classification task to guide the feature selection in our proposed Task Balanced Multimodal Feature Selection method. Our results, when compared against some widely used machine learning algorithms, show improved balanced accuracies, precision, and Matthew's correlation coefficients for identifying cognitive decline. In addition to the improved prediction performance, our method is able to identify brain and genetic biomarkers that are of interest to the clinical research community. Our experiments validate existing brain biomarkers and single nucleotide polymorphisms located on chromosome 11 and detail novel polymorphisms on chromosome 10 that, to the best of the authors' knowledge, have not previously been reported. We anticipate that our method will be of interest to the greater research community and have released our method's code online.11Code is provided at: https://github.com/minds-mines/TBMFSjl},

	abstract = {Motor neuron disease is an umbrella term encompassing a multitude of clinically heterogeneous phenotypes. The early and accurate categorisation of patients is hugely important, as MND phenotypes are associated with markedly different prognoses, progression rates, care needs and benefit from divergent management strategies. The categorisation of patients shortly after symptom onset is challenging, and often lengthy clinical monitoring is needed to assign patients to the appropriate phenotypic subgroup. In this study, a multi-class machine-learning strategy was implemented to classify 300 patients based on their radiological profile into diagnostic labels along the UMN-LMN spectrum. A comprehensive panel of cortical thickness measures, subcortical grey matter variables, and white matter integrity metrics were evaluated in a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Additional exploratory analyses were also carried out using discriminant function analyses (DFA). Excellent classification accuracy was achieved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the testing cohort (93.7\%) using the MLP model, but poor diagnostic accuracy was detected for primary lateral sclerosis (43.8\%) and poliomyelitis survivors (60\%). Feature importance analyses highlighted the relevance of white matter diffusivity metrics and the evaluation of cerebellar indices, cingulate measures and thalamic radiation variables to discriminate MND phenotypes. Our data suggest that radiological data from single patients may be meaningfully interpreted if large training data sets are available and the provision of diagnostic probability outcomes may be clinically useful in patients with short symptom duration. The computational interpretation of multimodal radiology datasets herald viable diagnostic, prognostic and clinical trial applications.},

	abstract = {Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time–frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from δ, θ, α1, α2, β EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multi-modal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s an irreversible neurodegenerative disease with the most far-reaching impact, the most extensive, and the most difficult to cure in the world. It is also the most common disease of Alzheimer’s disease. With the rapid rise of data mining, machine learning and other fields, they have penetrated various disciplines. In particular, research in the field of AD is developing rapidly and has demonstrated strong vitality. In terms of data, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) researchers collect, verify and use a variety of data modalities as predictors of disease, including MRI and PET images, genetics, cognitive testing, cerebrospinal fluid and blood biomarkers, etc. Therefore, this paper uses a multi-task learning algorithm based on the ADNI data set to implement regression tasks and predict the cognitive scores of subjects in the next 3 years. This method can effectively assess the cognitive trends of patients in the future and aims to predict the progression of the disease. In addition, we used four different machine learning classification algorithms to conduct fusion research on AD multi-modal data, including MRI, PET, and cognitive scoring data. This method can determine the current patient’s cognitive stage, to achieve the effect of assisting doctors in diagnosis. Finally, we designed a multi-modal data platform technical architecture to standardize management and sharing of ADNI data and data obtained by offline medical institutions to improve the utilization and value of data. The design of the technical architecture proposed in this article is more easily scalable and compatible with other neurological diseases. Nowadays, the large amount of data being generated by AD can provide valuable solutions for the research of disease progression prediction and auxiliary diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been used in the past for the auxiliary diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). However, most existing technologies only explore single-view data, require manual parameter setting and focus on two-class (i.e., dementia or not) classification problems. Unlike single-view data, multi-view data provide more powerful feature representation capability. Learning with multi-view data is referred to as multi-view learning, which has received certain attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a new multi-view clustering model called Consensus Multi-view Clustering (CMC) based on nonnegative matrix factorization for predicting the multiple stages of AD progression. The proposed CMC performs multi-view learning idea to fully capture data features with limited medical images, approaches similarity relations between different entities, addresses the shortcoming from multi-view fusion that requires manual setting parameters, and further acquires a consensus representation containing shared features and complementary knowledge of multiple view data. It not only can improve the predication performance of AD, but also can screen and classify the symptoms of different AD’s phases. Experimental results using data with twelve views constructed by brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) database from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative expound and prove the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging research topic of machine learning aimed at unboxing how AI systems’ black-box choices are made. This research field inspects the measures and models involved in decision-making and seeks solutions to explain them explicitly. Many of the machine learning algorithms cannot manifest how and why a decision has been cast. This is particularly true of the most popular deep neural network approaches currently in use. Consequently, our confidence in AI systems can be hindered by the lack of explainability in these black-box models. The XAI becomes more and more crucial for deep learning powered applications, especially for medical and healthcare studies, although in general these deep neural networks can return an arresting dividend in performance. The insufficient explainability and transparency in most existing AI systems can be one of the major reasons that successful implementation and integration of AI tools into routine clinical practice are uncommon. In this study, we first surveyed the current progress of XAI and in particular its advances in healthcare applications. We then introduced our solutions for XAI leveraging multi-modal and multi-centre data fusion, and subsequently validated in two showcases following real clinical scenarios. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses can prove the efficacy of our proposed XAI solutions, from which we can envisage successful applications in a broader range of clinical questions.},

	abstract = {Accurate prognosis of a tumor can help doctors provide a proper course of treatment and, therefore, save the lives of many. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been eminently useful in crafting prognostic models in the last few decades. Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown significant improvement when developing diagnosis and prognosis solutions to different healthcare problems. However, most of these solutions rely solely on either imaging or clinical data. Utilizing patient tabular data such as demographics and patient medical history alongside imaging data in a multimodal approach to solve a prognosis task has started to gain more interest recently and has the potential to create more accurate solutions. The main issue when using clinical and imaging data to train a deep learning model is to decide on how to combine the information from these sources. We propose a multimodal network that ensembles deep multi-task logistic regression (MTLR), Cox proportional hazard (CoxPH) and CNN models to predict prognostic outcomes for patients with head and neck tumors using patients’ clinical and imaging (CT and PET) data. Features from CT and PET scans are fused and then combined with patients’ electronic health records for the prediction. The proposed model is trained and tested on 224 and 101 patient records respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed ensemble solution achieves a C-index of 0.72 on The HECKTOR test set that saved us the first place in prognosis task of the HECKTOR challenge. The full implementation based on PyTorch is available on https://github.com/numanai/BioMedIA-Hecktor2021.},

Information from anatomical shape and tabular clinical data (demographics, biomarkers) are fused in a single neural network. The network is invariant to shape transformations and avoids the need to identify point correspondences between shapes. To account for right censored time-to-event data, i.e., when it is only known that a patient did not develop Alzheimer’s disease up to a particular time point, we employ a loss commonly used in survival analysis. Our network is trained end-to-end to combine information from a patient’s hippocampus shape and clinical biomarkers. Our experiments on data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative demonstrate that our proposed model is able to learn a shape descriptor that augments clinical biomarkers and outperforms a deep neural network on shape alone and a linear model on common clinical biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease leading to irreversible and progressive brain damage. Close monitoring is essential for slowing down the progression of AD. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Previous studies usually focused on extracting features from whole image or specific slices separately, but ignore the characteristics of each slice from multiple perspectives and the complementarity between features at different scales. In this study, we proposed a novel classification method based on the fusion of multi-view 2D and 3D convolutions for MRI-based AD diagnosis. Specifically, we first use multiple sub-networks to extract the local slice-level feature of each slice in different dimensions. Then a 3D convolution network was used to extract the global subject-level information of MRI. Finally, local and global information were fused to acquire more discriminative features. Experiments conducted on the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 dataset demonstrated the superiority of this proposed model over other state-of-the-art methods for their ability to discriminate AD and Normal Controls (NC). Our model achieves 90.2\% and 85.2\% of accuracy on ADNI-2 and ADNI-1 respectively, thus it can be effective in AD diagnosis.

In particular, DNNs have been used to seamlessly fuse heterogeneous information from neuroanatomy, genetics, biomarkers, and neuropsychological tests for highly accurate Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. On the other hand, their black-box nature is still a barrier for the adoption of such a system in the clinic, where interpretability is absolutely essential. We propose Shapley Value Explanation of Heterogeneous Neural Networks (SVEHNN) for explaining the Alzheimer’s diagnosis made by a DNN from the 3D point cloud of the neuroanatomy and tabular biomarkers. Our explanations are based on the Shapley value, which is the unique method that satisfies all fundamental axioms for local explanations previously established in the literature. Thus, SVEHNN has many desirable characteristics that previous work on interpretability for medical decision making is lacking. To avoid the exponential time complexity of the Shapley value, we propose to transform a given DNN into a Lightweight Probabilistic Deep Network without re-training, thus achieving a complexity only quadratic in the number of features. In our experiments on synthetic and real data, we show that we can closely approximate the exact Shapley value with a dramatically reduced runtime and can reveal the hidden knowledge the network has learned from the data.},

	abstract = {AI is remarkably successful and outperforms human experts in certain tasks, even in complex domains such as medicine. Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is “How can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques?”. In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability – not to confuse with causality – is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human–AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures.},

One of such area has been data science, where the sheer astronomical amount of available data has spurred sub-fields of research involving its storage, analysis, and use. One such area of focus in recent years has been the fusion of data coming from multiple modalities, called multi-modal data fusion, and their use and analysis for practical and employable applications. Because of the differences within the data types, ranging from infrared/radio-frequency to audio/visual, it is extremely difficult, if not flat-out impossible, to analyze them via one singular method. The need to fuse multiple data types and sources properly and adequately for analysis, therefore arises an extra degree of freedom for data-science. This paper provides a survey for multi-modal data fusion. We provide an in-depth review of multi-modal data fusion themes, and describe the methods for designing and developing such data fusion techniques. We include an overview for the different methods and levels of data fusion techniques. An overview of security of data-fusion techniques, is also provided which highlights the present gaps within the field that need to be addressed.},

	abstract = {Background
Over the past decade, the development of molecular high-throughput methods (omics) increased rapidly and provided new insights for cancer research. In parallel, deep learning approaches revealed the enormous potential for medical image analysis, especially in digital pathology. Combining image and omics data with deep learning tools may enable the discovery of new cancer biomarkers and a more precise prediction of patient prognosis. This systematic review addresses different multimodal fusion methods of convolutional neural network-based image analyses with omics data, focussing on the impact of data combination on the classification performance.
Methods
PubMed was screened for peer-reviewed articles published in English between January 2015 and June 2021 by two independent researchers. Search terms related to deep learning, digital pathology, omics, and multimodal fusion were combined.
Results
We identified a total of 11 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, namely studies that used convolutional neural networks for haematoxylin and eosin image analysis of patients with cancer in combination with integrated omics data. Publications were categorised according to their endpoints: 7 studies focused on survival analysis and 4 studies on prediction of cancer subtypes, malignancy or microsatellite instability with spatial analysis.
Conclusions
Image-based classifiers already show high performances in prognostic and predictive cancer diagnostics. The integration of omics data led to improved performance in all studies described here. However, these are very early studies that still require external validation to demonstrate their generalisability and robustness. Further and more comprehensive studies with larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate performance and determine clinical benefits.},

To take advantage of the rich information present in the radiology reports, we develop a neural network model that is trained on both images and free-text to assess pulmonary edema severity from chest radiographs at inference time. Our experimental results suggest that the joint image-text representation learning improves the performance of pulmonary edema assessment compared to a supervised model trained on images only. We also show the use of the text for explaining the image classification by the joint model. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to leverage free-text radiology reports for improving the image model performance in this application.

The proposed network consists of two sub-networks, view-specific and common sub-network. To remove the view discrepancy, the proposed DeepCorrSurv first explicitly maximizes the correlation among the views. Then it transfers feature hierarchies from view commonality and specifically fine-tunes on the survival regression task. Extensive experiments on real lung and brain tumor data sets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed DeepCorrSurv model using multiple modalities data across different tumor types.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been a nightmare to citizens, hospitals, healthcare practitioners, and the economy in 2020. The overwhelming number of confirmed cases and suspected cases put forward an unprecedented challenge to the hospital’s capacity of management and medical resource distribution. To reduce the possibility of cross-infection and attend a patient according to his severity level, expertly diagnosis and sophisticated medical examinations are often required but hard to fulfil during a pandemic. To facilitate the assessment of a patient’s severity, this paper proposes a multi-modality feature learning and fusion model for end-to-end covid patient severity prediction using the blood test supported electronic medical record (EMR) and chest computerized tomography (CT) scan images. To evaluate a patient’s severity by the co-occurrence of salient clinical features, the High-order Factorization Network (HoFN) is proposed to learn the impact of a set of clinical features without tedious feature engineering. On the other hand, an attention-based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using pre-trained parameters are used to process the lung CT images. Finally, to achieve cohesion of cross-modality representation, we design a loss function to shift deep features of both-modality into the same feature space which improves the model’s performance and robustness when one modality is absent.

	abstract = {The fusion of heterogeneous medical data is essential in precision medicine to assist medical experts in treatment decision-making. However, there is often little explicit correlation between data from different modalities such as histopathological images and tabular clinical data. Besides, attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) often lacks sufficient supervision to assign appropriate attention weights for informative image patches and thus generates a good global representation for the whole image. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-instance joint learning method, which fuses different modalities and magnification scales as a cross-modal representation to capture the potential complementary information and recalibrate the features in each modality. Furthermore, we leverage the information from tabular clinical data to optimize the MIL bag representation in the imaging modality. The proposed method is evaluated on a challenging medical task, i.e., lymph node metastasis (LNM) prediction of breast cancer, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance with AUC of 0.8844, outperforming the AUC of 0.7111 using histopathological images or the AUC of 0.8312 using tabular clinical data alone.

Assessing and accurately predicting pathological complete response is important in treatment planing for breast cancer patients. In this study, we propose a novel approach integrating 3D MRI imaging data, molecular data and demographic data using convolutional neural network to predict the likelihood of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer. We take post-contrast T1-weighted 3D MRI images without the need of tumor segmentation, and incorporate molecular subtypes and demographic data. In our predictive model, MRI data and non-imaging data are convolved to inform each other through interactions, instead of a concatenation of multiple data type channels. This is achieved by channel-wise multiplication of the intermediate results of imaging and non-imaging data. We use a subset of curated data from the I-SPY-1 TRIAL of 112 patients with stage 2 or 3 breast cancer with breast tumors underwent standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our method yielded an accuracy of 0.83, AUC of 0.80, sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.88. Our model significantly outperforms models using imaging data only or traditional concatenation models. Our approach has the potential to aid physicians to identify patients who are likely to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy at diagnosis or early treatment, thus facilitate treatment planning, treatment execution, or mid-treatment adjustment.},

We propose a novel method of combining thoracic Computerized Tomography (CT) scans and clinical tabular data to improve the prediction of EF risks in EC patients.

In addition, we devise a self-attention module, named VisText, to uncover the complex relationships and correlations among different features.

Given CT, general, diagnostic, pathological, and hematological clinical information, we firstly propose a graph construction strategy with category-wise contextual attention to embed multi-categorical features as graph node attributes. Secondly, we introduce a co-graph attention layer composed of a conventional graph attention network (con-GAT) and a correlation-based GAT (corr-GAT) to learn new representations. Corr-GAT complements con-GAT by difference-based correlations across image regions in global spectral space. Experimental results of ablation studies and comparison with others over 924 lymph nodes demonstrated improved performance and contributions of our major innovations.

The enormous success of graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) in disease prediction based on multi-site data has sparked recent interest in applying GCNs in diagnosis of ASD. However, the current research results are all based on shallow GCNs. The main objective of this research was to improve the classification results by using DeepGCN. We constructed a deep ASD diagnosing framework based on 16-layer GCN. And ResNet units and DropEdge strategy were integrated into the DeepGCN model to avoid the vanishing gradient, over-fitting and over-smoothing. We combined the scale information with neuroimaging to form a graph structure based on the ABIDE dataset I, which contains a total of 871 subjects from 17 sites. We compared the DeepGCN results with well-established models based on the same subjects. The mean accuracy of our classification algorithm is 73.7\% for classifying ASD versus normal controls (GCN: 70.4\%, SVM-l2: 66.8\%, Metric Learning: 62.9\%). We introduce a new perspective for studying the biological markers of early diagnosis of ASD based on multi-site and multi-modality data. Meanwhile, it can be easily applied to various mental illnesses.},

	abstract = {Dementia is a highly heterogeneous condition, with pronounced individual differences in age of onset, clinical presentation, progression rates and neuropathological hallmarks, even within a specific diagnostic group. However, the most common statistical designs used in dementia research studies and clinical trials overlook this heterogeneity, instead relying on comparisons of group average differences (e.g. patient versus control or treatment versus placebo), implicitly assuming within-group homogeneity. This one-size-fits-all approach potentially limits our understanding of dementia aetiology, hindering the identification of effective treatments. Neuroimaging has enabled the characterization of the average neuroanatomical substrates of dementias; however, the increasing availability of large open neuroimaging datasets provides the opportunity to examine patterns of neuroanatomical variability in individual patients. In this update, we outline the causes and consequences of heterogeneity in dementia and discuss recent research that aims to tackle heterogeneity directly, rather than assuming that dementia affects everyone in the same way. We introduce spatial normative modelling as an emerging data-driven technique, which can be applied to dementia data to model neuroanatomical variation, capturing individualized neurobiological ‘fingerprints’. Such methods have the potential to detect clinically relevant subtypes, track an individual’s disease progression or evaluate treatment responses, with the goal of moving towards precision medicine for dementia.},

When segmenting brain scans, CNNs are highly sensitive to changes in resolution and contrast: even within the same MRI modality, performance can decrease across datasets. Here we introduce SynthSeg, the first segmentation CNN agnostic to contrast and resolution. SynthSeg is trained with synthetic data sampled from a generative model conditioned on segmentations. Crucially, we adopt a domain randomisation strategy where we fully randomise the contrast and resolution of the synthetic training data. Consequently, SynthSeg can segment real scans of any target domain without retraining or fine-tuning, which enables, for the first time, analysis of huge amounts of heterogeneous clinical data. Because SynthSeg only requires segmentations to be trained (no images), it can learn from labels obtained by automated methods on subjects of different populations (e.g., ageing and diseased), thus achieving robustness to a wide range of morphological variability. We demonstrate SynthSeg on 5,300 scans of six modalities and ten resolutions, where it exhibits unparalleled generalisation compared with supervised CNNs, state-of-the-art domain adaptation, and Bayesian segmentation. Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of SynthSeg by applying it to cardiac MRI and CT segmentation.},

	abstract = {While the plethora of information from multiple imaging and non-imaging data streams presents an opportunity for discovery of fused multimodal, multiscale biomarkers, they also introduce multiple independent sources of noise that hinder their collective utility. The goal of this work is to create fused predictors of disease diagnosis and prognosis by combining multiple data streams, which we hypothesize will provide improved performance as compared to predictors from individual data streams. To achieve this goal, we introduce supervised multiview canonical correlation analysis (sMVCCA), a novel data fusion method that attempts to find a common representation for multiscale, multimodal data where class separation is maximized while noise is minimized. In doing so, sMVCCA assumes that the different sources of information are complementary and thereby act synergistically when combined. Although this method can be applied to any number of modalities and to any disease domain, we demonstrate its utility using three datasets. We fuse (i) 1.5 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features with cerbrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic measurements for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (n = 30), (ii) 3T Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI and T2w MRI for \textit{in vivo} prediction of prostate cancer grade on a per slice basis (n = 33) and (iii) quantitative histomorphometric features of glands and proteomic measurements from mass spectrometry for prediction of 5 year biochemical recurrence postradical prostatectomy (n = 40). Random Forest classifier applied to the sMVCCA fused subspace, as compared to that of MVCCA, PCA and LDA, yielded the highest classification AUC of 0.82 +/- 0.05, 0.76 +/- 0.01, 0.70 +/- 0.07, respectively for the aforementioned datasets. In addition, sMVCCA fused subspace provided 13.6\%, 7.6\% and 15.3\% increase in AUC as compared with that of the best performing individual view in each of the three datasets, respectively. For the biochemical recurrence dataset, Kaplan-Meier curves generated from classifier prediction in the fused subspace reached the significance threshold (p = 0.05) for distinguishing between patients with and without 5 year biochemical recurrence, unlike those generated from classifier predictions of the individual modalities.},

	abstract = {In this article, the authors aim to maximally utilize multimodality neuroimaging and genetic data for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal status, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), from normal aging subjects. Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights into brain abnormalities, while genetic data such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient's AD risk factors. When these data are used together, the accuracy of AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., with different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., with far less number of PET samples than the number of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combinations of modalities, via effective training using the maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity among modalities can be partially addressed, and high-level features from different modalities can be combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. To further increase the number of samples during training, we also use data at multiple scanning time points for each training subject in the dataset. We evaluate the proposed framework using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis, and the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and there is an urgent need to design computational methods that can accurately predict the prognosis of breast cancer for appropriate therapeutic regime. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved great success in prognosis prediction, but many of them directly combine features from different modalities that may ignore the complex inter-modality relations. In addition, existing deep learning-based methods do not take intra-modality relations into consideration that are also beneficial to prognosis prediction. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a deep learning-based method that can take advantage of the complementary information between intra-modality and inter-modality by integrating data from different modalities for more accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer.We present a novel unified framework named genomic and pathological deep bilinear network (GPDBN) for prognosis prediction of breast cancer by effectively integrating both genomic data and pathological images. In GPDBN, an inter-modality bilinear feature encoding module is proposed to model complex inter-modality relations for fully exploiting intrinsic relationship of the features across different modalities. Meanwhile, intra-modality relations that are also beneficial to prognosis prediction, are captured by two intra-modality bilinear feature encoding modules. Moreover, to take advantage of the complementary information between inter-modality and intra-modality relations, GPDBN further combines the inter- and intra-modality bilinear features by using a multi-layer deep neural network for final prognosis prediction. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed GPDBN significantly improves the performance of breast cancer prognosis prediction and compares favorably with existing methods.GPDBN is freely available at https://github.com/isfj/GPDBN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Previous graph-based approaches for supervised or unsupervised learning in the context of disease prediction solely focus on pairwise similarities between subjects, disregarding individual characteristics and features, or rather rely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors and fail to model interactions between them. In this paper, we present a thorough evaluation of a generic framework that leverages both imaging and non-imaging information and can be used for brain analysis in large populations. This framework exploits Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and involves representing populations as a sparse graph, where its nodes are associated with imaging-based feature vectors, while phenotypic information is integrated as edge weights. The extensive evaluation explores the effect of each individual component of this framework on disease prediction performance and further compares it to different baselines. The framework performance is tested on two large datasets with diverse underlying data, ABIDE and ADNI, for the prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder and conversion to Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. Our analysis shows that our novel framework can improve over state-of-the-art results on both databases, with 70.4\% classification accuracy for ABIDE and 80.0\% for ADNI.},

	abstract = {Healthcare data are inherently multimodal, including electronic health records (EHR), medical images, and multi-omics data. Combining these multimodal data sources contributes to a better understanding of human health and provides optimal personalized healthcare. The most important question when using multimodal data is how to fuse them—a field of growing interest among researchers. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly machine learning (ML), enable the fusion of these different data modalities to provide multimodal insights. To this end, in this scoping review, we focus on synthesizing and analyzing the literature that uses AI techniques to fuse multimodal medical data for different clinical applications. More specifically, we focus on studies that only fused EHR with medical imaging data to develop various AI methods for clinical applications. We present a comprehensive analysis of the various fusion strategies, the diseases and clinical outcomes for which multimodal fusion was used, the ML algorithms used to perform multimodal fusion for each clinical application, and the available multimodal medical datasets. We followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar to retrieve relevant studies. After pre-processing and screening, we extracted data from 34 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. We found that studies fusing imaging data with EHR are increasing and doubling from 2020 to 2021. In our analysis, a typical workflow was observed: feeding raw data, fusing different data modalities by applying conventional machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms, and finally, evaluating the multimodal fusion through clinical outcome predictions. Specifically, early fusion was the most used technique in most applications for multimodal learning (22 out of 34 studies). We found that multimodality fusion models outperformed traditional single-modality models for the same task. Disease diagnosis and prediction were the most common clinical outcomes (reported in 20 and 10 studies, respectively) from a clinical outcome perspective. Neurological disorders were the dominant category (16 studies). From an AI perspective, conventional ML models were the most used (19 studies), followed by DL models (16 studies). Multimodal data used in the included studies were mostly from private repositories (21 studies). Through this scoping review, we offer new insights for researchers interested in knowing the current state of knowledge within this research field.},

	abstract = {According to medical reports and statistics, skin diseases have millions of victims worldwide. These diseases might affect the health and life of patients and increase the costs of healthcare services. Delays in diagnosing such diseases make it difficult to overcome the consequences of these types of disease. Usually, diagnosis is performed using dermoscopic images, where specialists utilize certain measures to produce the results. This approach to diagnosis faces multiple disadvantages, such as overlapping infectious and inflammatory skin diseases and high levels of visual diversity, obstructing accurate diagnosis. Therefore, this article uses medical image analysis and artificial intelligence to present an automatic diagnosis system of different skin lesion categories using dermoscopic images. The addressed diseases are actinic keratoses (solar keratoses), benign keratosis (BKL), melanocytic nevi (NV), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), dermatofibroma (DF), melanoma (MEL), and vascular skin lesions (VASC). The proposed system consists of four main steps: (i) preprocessing the input raw image data and metadata; (ii) feature extraction using six pre-trained deep learning models (i.e., VGG19, InceptionV3, ResNet50, DenseNet201, and Xception); (iii) features concatenation; and (iv) classification/diagnosis using machine learning techniques. The evaluation results showed an average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and disc similarity coefficient (DSC) of around 99.94\%, 91.48\%, 98.82\%, 97.01\%, and 94.00\%, respectively.},

Important challenges in multimodal learning are the inference of shared representations from arbitrary modalities and cross-modal generation via these representations; however, achieving this requires taking the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data into account. In recent years, deep generative models, i.e., generative models in which distributions are parameterized by deep neural networks, have attracted much attention, especially variational autoencoders, which are suitable for accomplishing the above challenges because they can consider heterogeneity and infer good representations of data. Therefore, various multimodal generative models based on variational autoencoders, called multimodal deep generative models, have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we provide a categorized survey of studies on multimodal deep generative models.},

	abstract = {Fusion of multimodal imaging data with nonimaging data is critically important for a more complete understanding of the disease characteristics and therefore essential to accurate computer-aided diagnosis. However, there are two major challenges. 1) Effective discovery of the discriminative multimodal information during the fusion process is hindered by the large dimension gap between raw medical images and clinical factors. 2) Interpreting the complex nonlinear cross-modal association, especially in deep-network-based fusion models, remains an unsolved challenge, which is essential for uncovering the disease mechanism. To address the two challenges, we propose an Interpretable Deep Multimodal Fusion (DMFusion) Framework based on Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). Specifically, a novel DMFusion loss is proposed to optimize the discovery of discriminative multimodal representations in low-dimensional latent fusion space. It is achieved by jointly exploiting intermodal correlational association via CCA loss and intra-modal structural and discriminative information via reconstruction loss and cross-entropy loss. For interpreting the nonlinear cross-modal association in DMFusion network, we propose a cross-modal association (CA) score to quantify the importance of input features towards the correlated association, by harnessing integrated gradients in deep networks and canonical loading in CCA projection. The proposed fusion framework was validated on the differential diagnosis of demyelinating diseases in Central Nervous System (CNS) and outperformed six state-of-the-art methods on three fusion tasks.},

Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning.

In order to provide patients with the most effective treatment for these aggressive tumours, multimodal learning is emerging as a new and promising field of research that aims to extract complementary information from the data of different modalities for prognostic and predictive purposes. This knowledge could be used to optimise current treatments and maximise their effectiveness. To predict overall survival, in this work, we investigate the use of multimodal learning on the CLARO dataset, which includes CT images and clinical data collected from a cohort of non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Our method allows the identification of the optimal set of classifiers to be included in the ensemble in a late fusion approach. Specifically, after training unimodal models on each modality, it selects the best ensemble by solving a multiobjective optimisation problem that maximises both the recognition performance and the diversity of the predictions. In the ensemble, the labels of each sample are assigned using the majority voting rule. As further validation, we show that the proposed ensemble outperforms the models learning a single modality, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the task at hand.},

Deep learning advances have the potential to make major contributions to healthcare, particularly in the domains that rely on medical imaging. Incorporating non-imaging information based on clinical and laboratory data may allow clinicians to make more comprehensive and accurate decisions. Methods: Here, we developed a multimodal deep learning method to predict systemic diseases and disorders from oral health conditions. A dual-loss autoencoder was used in the first phase to extract periodontal disease-related features from 1188 panoramic radiographs. Then, in the second phase, we fused the image features with the demographic data and clinical information taken from electronic health records (EHR) to predict systemic diseases. We used receiver operation characteristics (ROC) and accuracy to evaluate our model. The model was further validated by an unseen test dataset. Findings: According to our findings, the top three most accurately predicted chapters, in order, are the Chapters III, VI and IX. The results indicated that the proposed model could predict systemic diseases belonging to Chapters III, VI and IX, with AUC values of 0.92 (95\% CI, 0.90–94), 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.84–89) and 0.78 (95\% CI, 0.75–81), respectively. To assess the robustness of the models, we performed the evaluation on the unseen test dataset for these chapters and the results showed an accuracy of 0.88, 0.82 and 0.72 for Chapters III, VI and IX, respectively. Interpretation: The present study shows that the combination of panoramic radiograph and clinical oral features could be considered to train a fusion deep learning model for predicting systemic diseases and disorders.},

	abstract = {The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic over a relatively brief interval illustrates the need for rapid data-driven approaches to facilitate clinical decision making. We examined a machine learning process to predict inpatient mortality among COVID-19 patients using clinical and chest radiographic data. Modeling was performed with a de-identified dataset of encounters prior to widespread vaccine availability. Non-imaging predictors included demographics, pre-admission clinical history, and past medical history variables. Imaging features were extracted from chest radiographs by applying a deep convolutional neural network with transfer learning. A multi-layer perceptron combining 64 deep learning features from chest radiographs with 98 patient clinical features was trained to predict mortality. The Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) method was used to explain model predictions. Non-imaging data alone predicted mortality with an ROC-AUC of 0.87 ± 0.03 (mean ± SD), while the addition of imaging data improved prediction slightly (ROC-AUC: 0.91 ± 0.02). The application of LIME to the combined imaging and clinical model found HbA1c values to contribute the most to model prediction (17.1 ± 1.7\%), while imaging contributed 8.8 ± 2.8\%. Age, gender, and BMI contributed 8.7\%, 8.2\%, and 7.1\%, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a viable explainable AI approach to quantify the contributions of imaging and clinical data to COVID mortality predictions.},

              Motivation
              Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an indicator of the efficacy and prognosis of immune checkpoint therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC). In general, patients with higher TMB values are more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Though whole-exome sequencing is considered the gold standard for determining TMB, it is difficult to be applied in clinical practice due to its high cost. There are also a few DNA panel-based methods to estimate TMB; however, their detection cost is also high, and the associated wet-lab experiments usually take days, which emphasize the need for faster and cheaper alternatives.
            
            
              Results
              In this study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning model based on a residual network (ResNet) and multi-modal compact bilinear pooling to predict TMB status (i.e. TMB high (TMB\_H) or TMB low(TMB\_L)) directly from histopathological images and clinical data. We applied the model to CRC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and compared it with four other popular methods, namely, ResNet18, ResNet50, VGG19 and AlexNet. We tested different TMB thresholds, namely, percentiles of 10\%, 14.3\%, 15\%, 16.3\%, 20\%, 30\% and 50\%, to differentiate TMB\_H and TMB\_L.
              For the percentile of 14.3\% (i.e. TMB value 20) and ResNet18, our model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.817 after 5-fold cross-validation, which was better than that of other compared models. In addition, we also found that TMB values were significantly associated with the tumor stage and N and M stages. Our study shows that deep learning models can predict TMB status from histopathological images and clinical information only, which is worth clinical application.},

	abstract = {The Cardiotocography (CTG) is a widely diffused monitoring practice, used in Ob-Gyn Clinic to assess the fetal well-being through the analysis of the Fetal Heart Rate (FHR) and the Uterine contraction signals. Due to the complex dynamics regulating the Fetal Heart Rate, a reliable visual interpretation of the signal is almost impossible and results in significant subjective inter and intra-observer variability. Also, the introduction of few parameters obtained from computer analysis did not solve the problem of a robust antenatal diagnosis. Hence, during the last decade, computer aided diagnosis systems, based on artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning techniques have been developed to assist medical decisions. The present work proposes a hybrid approach based on a neural architecture that receives heterogeneous data in input (a set of quantitative parameters and images) for classifying healthy and pathological fetuses. The quantitative regressors, which are known to represent different aspects of the correct development of the fetus, and thus are related to the fetal healthy status, are combined with features implicitly extracted from various representations of the FHR signal (images), in order to improve the classification performance. This is achieved by setting a neural model with two connected branches, consisting respectively of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The neural architecture was trained on a huge and balanced set of clinical data (14.000 CTG tracings, 7000 healthy and 7000 pathological) recorded during ambulatory non stress tests at the University Hospital Federico II, Napoli, Italy. After hyperparameters tuning and training, the neural network proposed has reached an overall accuracy of 80.1\%, which is a promising result, as it has been obtained on a huge dataset.},

	abstract = {Objectives
              A subset of non-functioning pituitary macroadenomas (NFMAs) may exhibit early progression/recurrence (P/R) after tumor resection. The purpose of this study was to apply deep learning (DL) algorithms for prediction of P/R in NFMAs.
            
            
              Methods
              From June 2009 to December 2019, 78 patients diagnosed with pathologically confirmed NFMAs, and who had undergone complete preoperative MRI and postoperative MRI follow-up for more than one year, were included. DL classifiers including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to build predictive models. Categorical and continuous clinical data were fed into the MLP model, and images of preoperative MRI (T2WI and contrast enhanced T1WI) were analyzed by the CNN model. MLP, CNN and multimodal CNN-MLP architectures were performed to predict P/R in NFMAs.
            
            
              Results
              Forty-two (42/78, 53.8\%) patients exhibited P/R after surgery. The median follow-up time was 42 months, and the median time to P/R was 25 months. As compared with CNN using MRI (accuracy 83\%, precision 87\%, and AUC 0.84) or MLP using clinical data (accuracy 73\%, precision 73\%, and AUC 0.73) alone, the multimodal CNN-MLP model using both clinical and MRI features showed the best performance for prediction of P/R in NFMAs, with accuracy 83\%, precision 90\%, and AUC 0.85.
            
            
              Conclusions
              DL architecture incorporating clinical and MRI features performs well to predict P/R in NFMAs. Pending more studies to support the findings, the results of this study may provide valuable information for NFMAs treatment planning.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Breast cancer patients often have recurrence and metastasis after surgery. Predicting the risk of recurrence and metastasis for a breast cancer patient is essential for the development of precision treatment. In this study, we proposed a novel multi-modal deep learning prediction model by integrating hematoxylin \& eosin (H\&E)-stained histopathological images, clinical information and gene expression data. Specifically, we segmented tumor regions in H\&E into image blocks (256 × 256 pixels) and encoded each image block into a 1D feature vector using a deep neural network. Then, the attention module scored each area of the H\&E-stained images and combined image features with clinical and gene expression data to predict the risk of recurrence and metastasis for each patient. To test the model, we downloaded all 196 breast cancer samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas with clinical, gene expression and H\&E information simultaneously available. The samples were then divided into the training and testing sets with a ratio of 7: 3, in which the distributions of the samples were kept between the two datasets by hierarchical sampling. The multi-modal model achieved an area-under-the-curve value of 0.75 on the testing set better than those based solely on H\&E image, sequencing data and clinical data, respectively. This study might have clinical significance in identifying high-risk breast cancer patients, who may benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective. Electronic health records (EHRs) contain free-text information on symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of diseases. However, this potential goldmine of health information cannot be easily accessed and used unless proper text mining techniques are applied. The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate a text mining pipeline in a multimodal learning architecture to demonstrate the value of medical text classification in chest radiograph reports for cardiovascular risk prediction. We sought to assess the integration of various text representation approaches and clinical structured data with state-of-the-art deep learning methods in the process of medical text mining. Methods. We used EHR data of patients included in the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study. We propose a deep learning-based multimodal architecture for our text mining pipeline that integrates neural text representation with preprocessed clinical predictors for the prediction of recurrence of major cardiovascular events in cardiovascular patients. Text preprocessing, including cleaning and stemming, was first applied to filter out the unwanted texts from X-ray radiology reports. Thereafter, text representation methods were used to numerically represent unstructured radiology reports with vectors. Subsequently, these text representation methods were added to prediction models to assess their clinical relevance. In this step, we applied logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron neural network, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and bidirectional LSTM deep neural network (BiLSTM). Results. We performed various experiments to evaluate the added value of the text in the prediction of major cardiovascular events. The two main scenarios were the integration of radiology reports (1) with classical clinical predictors and (2) with only age and sex in the case of unavailable clinical predictors. In total, data of 5603 patients were used with 5-fold cross-validation to train the models. In the first scenario, the multimodal BiLSTM (MI-BiLSTM) model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 84.7\%, misclassification rate of 14.3\%, and F1 score of 83.8\%. In this scenario, the SVM model, trained on clinical variables and bag-of-words representation, achieved the lowest misclassification rate of 12.2\%. In the case of unavailable clinical predictors, the MI-BiLSTM model trained on radiology reports and demographic (age and sex) variables reached an AUC, F1 score, and misclassification rate of 74.5\%, 70.8\%, and 20.4\%, respectively. Conclusions. Using the case study of routine care chest X-ray radiology reports, we demonstrated the clinical relevance of integrating text features and classical predictors in our text mining pipeline for cardiovascular risk prediction. The MI-BiLSTM model with word embedding representation appeared to have a desirable performance when trained on text data integrated with the clinical variables from the SMART study. Our results mined from chest X-ray reports showed that models using text data in addition to laboratory values outperform those using only known clinical predictors.},

              Background
              The identification of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), which is an early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is associated with brain structural and functional changes, is still a challenging task. Recent studies show great promises for improving the performance of EMCI identification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and shortest path length. However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of EMCI identification have always been a challenging problem. To address this problem, in this study we propose a new EMCI identification framework using multi-modal data and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly, we extract grey matter volume and shortest path length of each brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas as feature representation from T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject, respectively. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in identifying EMCI, a common multi-task feature selection method is applied. Afterwards, we construct a non-fully labelled subject graph using imaging and non-imaging phenotypic measures of each subject. Finally, a GCN model is adopted to perform the EMCI identification task.
            
            
              Results
              Our proposed EMCI identification method is evaluated on 210 subjects, including 105 subjects with EMCI and 105 normal controls (NCs), with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 84.1\% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.856 for EMCI/NC classification. In addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed framework are better than those of some existing methods in EMCI identification.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Our proposed EMCI identification framework is effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of EMCI in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of disabled survivors of prematurity has increased dramatically in the past 3 decades. These survivors, especially, very preterm infants (VPIs), born ≤ 32 weeks gestational age, are at high risk for neurodevelopmental impairments. Early and clinically effective personalized prediction of outcomes, which forms the basis for early treatment decisions, is urgently needed during the peak neuroplasticity window—the first couple of years after birth—for at-risk infants, when intervention is likely to be most effective. Advances in MRI enable the noninvasive visualization of infants' brains through acquired multimodal images, which are more informative than unimodal MRI data by providing complementary/supplementary depicting of brain tissue characteristics and pathology. Thus, analyzing quantitative multimodal MRI features affords unique opportunities to study early postnatal brain development and neurodevelopmental outcome prediction in VPIs. In this study, we investigated the predictive power of multimodal MRI data, including T2-weighted anatomical MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and clinical data for the prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. We hypothesize that integrating multimodal MRI and clinical data improves the prediction over using each individual data modality. Employing the aforementioned multimodal data, we proposed novel end-to-end deep multimodal models to predict neurodevelopmental (i.e., cognitive, language, and motor) deficits independently at 2 years corrected age. We found that the proposed models can predict cognitive, language, and motor deficits at 2 years corrected age with an accuracy of 88.4, 87.2, and 86.7\%, respectively, significantly better than using individual data modalities. This current study can be considered as proof-of-concept. A larger study with external validation is important to validate our approach to further assess its clinical utility and overall generalizability.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              Liver cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death globally, and the treatment strategies are distinct for each type of malignant hepatic tumors. However, the differential diagnosis before surgery is challenging and subjective. This study aims to build an automatic diagnostic model for differentiating malignant hepatic tumors based on patients’ multimodal medical data including multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed tomography and clinical features.
            
            
              Methods
              
                Our study consisted of 723 patients from two centers, who were pathologically diagnosed with HCC, ICC or metastatic liver cancer. The training set and the test set consisted of 499 and 113 patients from center 1, respectively. The external test set consisted of 111 patients from center 2. We proposed a deep learning model with the modular design of
                SpatialExtractor-TemporalEncoder-Integration-Classifier
                (STIC), which take the advantage of deep CNN and gated RNN to effectively extract and integrate the diagnosis-related radiological and clinical features of patients. The code is publicly available at
                https://github.com/ruitian-olivia/STIC-model
                .
              
            
            
              Results
              The STIC model achieved an accuracy of 86.2\% and AUC of 0.893 for classifying HCC and ICC on the test set. When extended to differential diagnosis of malignant hepatic tumors, the STIC model achieved an accuracy of 72.6\% on the test set, comparable with the diagnostic level of doctors’ consensus (70.8\%). With the assistance of the STIC model, doctors achieved better performance than doctors’ consensus diagnosis, with an increase of 8.3\% in accuracy and 26.9\% in sensitivity for ICC diagnosis on average. On the external test set from center 2, the STIC model achieved an accuracy of 82.9\%, which verify the model’s generalization ability.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We incorporated deep CNN and gated RNN in the STIC model design for differentiating malignant hepatic tumors based on multi-phase CECT and clinical features. Our model can assist doctors to achieve better diagnostic performance, which is expected to serve as an AI assistance system and promote the precise treatment of liver cancer.},

	abstract = {Cancer is one of the most detrimental diseases globally. Accordingly, the prognosis prediction of cancer patients has become a field of interest. In this review, we have gathered 43 state-of-the-art scientific papers published in the last 6 years that built cancer prognosis predictive models using multimodal data. We have defined the multimodality of data as four main types: clinical, anatomopathological, molecular, and medical imaging; and we have expanded on the information that each modality provides. The 43 studies were divided into three categories based on the modelling approach taken, and their characteristics were further discussed together with current issues and future trends. Research in this area has evolved from survival analysis through statistical modelling using mainly clinical and anatomopathological data to the prediction of cancer prognosis through a multi-faceted data-driven approach by the integration of complex, multimodal, and high-dimensional data containing multi-omics and medical imaging information and by applying Machine Learning and, more recently, Deep Learning techniques. This review concludes that cancer prognosis predictive multimodal models are capable of better stratifying patients, which can improve clinical management and contribute to the implementation of personalised medicine as well as provide new and valuable knowledge on cancer biology and its progression.},

This paper presents an integrated model for multidimensional information fusion. By integrating the best classification models determined by single and multiple features, different feature information is combined to better identify suicidal posts in online social media. This approach was assessed with a dataset formed from 40,222 posts annotated by Weibo. By integrating the best classification model of single features and multidimensional features, the proposed model ((BSC + RFS)-fs, WEC-fs) achieved 80.61\% accuracy and a 79.20\% F1-score. Other representative text information representation methods and demographic factors related to suicide may also be important predictors of suicide, which were not considered in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the good try that feature combination and ensemble algorithms have been fused to detect user-generated content with suicidal ideation. The findings suggest that feature combinations do not always work well, and that an appropriate combination strategy can make classification models work better. There are differences in the information contained in different functional carriers, and a targeted choice classification model may improve the detection rate of suicidal ideation.},

            Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), characterized by serous detachment of the macular retina, can cause permanent vision loss in the chronic course. Chronic CSC is generally treated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is costly and quite invasive, and the results are unpredictable. In a retrospective case–control study design, we developed a two-stage deep learning model to predict 1-year outcome of PDT using initial multimodal clinical data. The training dataset included 166 eyes with chronic CSC and an additional learning dataset containing 745 healthy control eyes. A pre-trained ResNet50-based convolutional neural network was first trained with normal fundus photographs (FPs) to detect CSC and then adapted to predict CSC treatability through transfer learning. The domain-specific ResNet50 successfully predicted treatable and refractory CSC (accuracy, 83.9\%). Then other multimodal clinical data were integrated with the FP deep features using XGBoost.The final combined model (DeepPDT-Net) outperformed the domain-specific ResNet50 (accuracy, 88.0\%). The FP deep features had the greatest impact on DeepPDT-Net performance, followed by central foveal thickness and age. In conclusion, DeepPDT-Net could solve the PDT outcome prediction task challenging even to retinal specialists. This two-stage strategy, adopting transfer learning and concatenating multimodal data, can overcome the clinical prediction obstacles arising from insufficient datasets.},

              To develop a fusion model combining clinical variables, deep learning (DL), and radiomics features to predict the functional outcomes early in patients with adult anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis in Southwest China.
            
            
              Methods
              
                From January 2012, a two-center study of anti-NMDAR encephalitis was initiated to collect clinical and MRI data from acute patients in Southwest China. Two experienced neurologists independently assessed the patients’ prognosis at 24 moths based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (good outcome defined as mRS 0–2; bad outcome defined as mRS 3-6). Risk factors influencing the prognosis of patients with acute anti-NMDAR encephalitis were investigated using clinical data. Five DL and radiomics models trained with four single or combined four MRI sequences (T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging and diffusion weighted imaging) and a clinical model were developed to predict the prognosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. A fusion model combing a clinical model and two machine learning-based models was built. The performances of the fusion model, clinical model, DL-based models and radiomics-based models were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy and then assessed by paired t-tests (
                P
                \&lt; 0.05 was considered significant).
              
            
            
              Results
              The fusion model achieved the significantly greatest predictive performance in the internal test dataset with an AUC of 0.963 [95\% CI: (0.874-0.999)], and also significantly exhibited an equally good performance in the external validation dataset, with an AUC of 0.927 [95\% CI: (0.688-0.975)]. The radiomics\_combined model (AUC: 0.889; accuracy: 0.857) provided significantly superior predictive performance than the DL\_combined (AUC: 0.845; accuracy: 0.857) and clinical models (AUC: 0.840; accuracy: 0.905), whereas the clinical model showed significantly higher accuracy. Compared with all single-sequence models, the DL\_combined model and the radiomics\_combined model had significantly greater AUCs and accuracies.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The fusion model combining clinical variables and machine learning-based models may have early predictive value for poor outcomes associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.},

              In radiation oncology, predicting patient risk stratification allows specialization of therapy intensification as well as selecting between systemic and regional treatments, all of which helps to improve patient outcome and quality of life. Deep learning offers an advantage over traditional radiomics for medical image processing by learning salient features from training data originating from multiple datasets. However, while their large capacity allows to combine high-level medical imaging data for outcome prediction, they lack generalization to be used across institutions. In this work, a pseudo-volumetric convolutional neural network with a deep preprocessor module and self-attention (PreSANet) is proposed for the prediction of distant metastasis, locoregional recurrence, and overall survival occurrence probabilities within the 10 year follow-up time frame for head and neck cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma. The model is capable of processing multi-modal inputs of variable scan length, as well as integrating patient data in the prediction model. These proposed architectural features and additional modalities all serve to extract additional information from the available data when availability to additional samples is limited. This model was trained on the public Cancer Imaging Archive Head–Neck-PET–CT dataset consisting of 298 patients undergoing curative radio/chemo-radiotherapy and acquired from 4 different institutions. The model was further validated on an internal retrospective dataset with 371 patients acquired from one of the institutions in the training dataset. An extensive set of ablation experiments were performed to test the utility of the proposed model characteristics, achieving an AUROC of

	abstract = {Radiomics-guided prediction of overall survival (OS) in brain gliomas is seen as a significant problem in Neuro-oncology. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust MRI-based approach (i.e., a radiomics model) that can accurately classify a novel subject as a short-term survivor, a medium-term survivor, or a long-term survivor. The BraTS 2020 challenge provides radiological imaging and clinical data (
              178
              subjects) to develop and validate radiomics-based methods for OS classification in brain gliomas. In this study, we empirically evaluated the efficacy of four multiregional radiomic models, for OS classification, and quantified the robustness of predictions to variations in automatic segmentation of brain tumor volume. More specifically, we evaluated four radiomic models, namely, the Whole Tumor (
              WT
              ) radiomics model, the
              3-subregions
              radiomics model, the
              6-subregions
              radiomics model, and the
              21-subregions
              radiomics model. The
              3-subregions
              radiomics model is based on a physiological segmentation of whole tumor volume (WT) into three non-overlapping subregions. The
              6-subregions
              and
              21-subregions
              radiomic models are based on an anatomical segmentation of the brain tumor into
              6
              and
              21
              anatomical regions, respectively. Moreover, we employed six segmentation schemes – five CNNs and one STAPLE-fusion method – to quantify the robustness of radiomic models. Our experiments revealed that the
              3-subregions
              radiomics model had the best predictive performance (mean AUC = 0.73) but poor robustness (RSD = 1.99) and the
              6-subregions
              and
              21-subregions
              radiomics models were more robust (RSD  1.39) with lower predictive performance (mean AUC  0.71). The poor robustness of the
              3-subregions
              radiomics model was associated with highly variable and inferior segmentation of tumor core and active tumor subregions as quantified by the Hausdorff distance metric (4.4−6.5mm) across six segmentation schemes. Failure analysis revealed that the
              WT
              radiomics model, the
              6-subregions
              radiomics model, and the
              21-subregions
              radiomics model failed for the same subjects which is attributed to the common requirement of accurate segmentation of the WT volume. Moreover, short-term survivors were largely misclassified by the radiomic models and had large segmentation errors (average Hausdorff distance of 7.09mm). Lastly, we concluded that while STAPLE-fusion can reduce segmentation errors, it is not a solution to learning accurate and robust radiomic models.},

	abstract = {Background
              Differential diagnosis of demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system is a challenging task that is prone to errors and inconsistent reading, requiring expertise and additional examination approaches. Advancements in deep-learning-based image interpretations allow for prompt and automated analyses of conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can be utilized in classifying multi-sequence MRI, and thus may help in subsequent treatment referral.
            
            
              Methods
              Imaging and clinical data from 290 patients diagnosed with demyelinating diseases from August 2013 to October 2021 were included for analysis, including 67 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 162 patients with aquaporin 4 antibody-positive (AQP4+) neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), and 61 patients with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD). Considering the heterogeneous nature of lesion size and distribution in demyelinating diseases, multi-modal MRI of brain and/or spinal cord were utilized to build the deep-learning model. This novel transformer-based deep-learning model architecture was designed to be versatile in handling with multiple image sequences (coronal T2-weighted and sagittal T2-fluid attenuation inversion recovery) and scanning locations (brain and spinal cord) for differentiating among MS, NMOSD, and MOGAD. Model performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and the confusion matrices measurements. The classification accuracy between the fusion model and the neuroradiological raters was also compared.
            
            
              Results
              The fusion model that was trained with combined brain and spinal cord MRI achieved an overall improved performance, with the AUC of 0.933 (95\%CI: 0.848, 0.991), 0.942 (95\%CI: 0.879, 0.987) and 0.803 (95\%CI: 0.629, 0.949) for MS, AQP4+ NMOSD, and MOGAD, respectively. This exceeded the performance using the brain or spinal cord MRI alone for the identification of the AQP4+ NMOSD (AUC of 0.940, brain only and 0.689, spinal cord only) and MOGAD (0.782, brain only and 0.714, spinal cord only). In the multi-category classification, the fusion model had an accuracy of 81.4\%, which was significantly higher compared to rater 1 (64.4\%, p=0.04\&lt;0.05) and comparable to rater 2 (74.6\%, p=0.388).
            
            
              Conclusion
              The proposed novel transformer-based model showed desirable performance in the differentiation of MS, AQP4+ NMOSD, and MOGAD on brain and spinal cord MRI, which is comparable to that of neuroradiologists. Our model is thus applicable for interpretating conventional MRI in the differential diagnosis of demyelinating diseases with overlapping lesions.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. It is one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging population AD cardinal symptoms include memory and executive function impairment that profoundly alters a patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living. People with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibit many of the early clinical symptoms of patients with AD and have a high chance of converting to AD in their lifetime. Diagnostic criteria rely on clinical assessment and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Many groups are working to help automate this process to improve the clinical workflow. Current computational approaches are focused on predicting whether or not a subject with MCI will convert to AD in the future. To our knowledge, limited attention has been given to the development of automated computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems able to provide an AD conversion diagnosis in MCI patient cohorts followed longitudinally. This is important as these CAD systems could be used by primary care providers to monitor patients with MCI. The method outlined in this paper addresses this gap and presents a computationally efficient pre-processing and prediction pipeline, and is designed for recognizing patterns associated with AD conversion. We propose a new approach that leverages longitudinal data that can be easily acquired in a clinical setting (e.g., T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, cognitive tests, and demographic information) to identify the AD conversion point in MCI subjects with AUC = 84.7. In contrast, cognitive tests and demographics alone achieved AUC = 80.6, a statistically significant difference (

The model architecture combines Attention and Inception architectures while utilizing both cross-sectional and longitudinal imaging and clinical information. Additionally, the top brain regions and clinical features that drove the model’s decision were investigated. These included the thalamus, caudate, planum temporale, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.

              Motivation
              Estimating the future course of patients with cancer lesions is invaluable to physicians; however, current clinical methods fail to effectively use the vast amount of multimodal data that is available for cancer patients. To tackle this problem, we constructed a multimodal neural network-based model to predict the survival of patients for 20 different cancer types using clinical data, mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data and histopathology whole slide images (WSIs). We developed an unsupervised encoder to compress these four data modalities into a single feature vector for each patient, handling missing data through a resilient, multimodal dropout method. Encoding methods were tailored to each data type—using deep highway networks to extract features from clinical and genomic data, and convolutional neural networks to extract features from WSIs.
            
            
              Results
              We used pancancer data to train these feature encodings and predict single cancer and pancancer overall survival, achieving a C-index of 0.78 overall. This work shows that it is possible to build a pancancer model for prognosis that also predicts prognosis in single cancer sites. Furthermore, our model handles multiple data modalities, efficiently analyzes WSIs and represents patient multimodal data flexibly into an unsupervised, informative representation. We thus present a powerful automated tool to accurately determine prognosis, a key step towards personalized treatment for cancer patients.

Seventy-two surgical trainees and faculty were recruited for the knot-tying task, and were recorded using video, kinematic, and image data. Three expert human raters conducted the skills assessment using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) Global Rating Scale (GRS). We also designed and developed three deep learning models: a ResNet-based image model, a ResNet-LSTM kinematic model, and a multi-modal model leveraging the image and time-series kinematic data. All three models demonstrate performance comparable to the expert human raters on most GRS domains. The multi-modal model demonstrates the best overall performance, as measured using the mean squared error (MSE) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). This work is significant since it demonstrates that multi-modal deep learning has the potential to replicate human raters on a challenging human-performed knot-tying task. The study demonstrates an algorithm with state-of-the-art performance in surgical skill assessment. As objective assessment of technical skill continues to be a growing, but resource-heavy, element of surgical education, this study is an important step towards automated surgical skill assessment, ultimately leading to reduced burden on training faculty and institutes.},

This study aimed to build a machine learning (ML) prediction model and an application system for a personalized analysis of the risk of HC in patients undergoing IVT therapy. We included patients from Chongqing, Hainan and other centers, including Computed Tomography (CT) images, demographics, and other data, before the occurrence of HC. After feature engineering, a better feature subset was obtained, which was used to build a machine learning (ML) prediction model (Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)), and then evaluated with relevant indicators. Finally, a prediction model with better performance was obtained. Based on this, an application system was built using the Flask framework. A total of 517 patients were included, of which 332 were in the training cohort, 83 were in the internal validation cohort, and 102 were in the external validation cohort. After evaluation, the performance of the XGB model is better, with an AUC of 0.9454 and ACC of 0.8554 on the internal validation cohort, and 0.9142 and ACC of 0.8431 on the external validation cohort. A total of 18 features were used to construct the model, including hemoglobin and fasting blood sugar. Furthermore, the validity of the model is demonstrated through decision curves. Subsequently, a system prototype is developed to verify the test prediction effect. The clinical decision support system (CDSS) embedded with the XGB model based on clinical data and image features can better carry out personalized analysis of the risk of HC in intravenous injection patients.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Biomedical ontologies are widely used to harmonize heterogeneous data and integrate large volumes of clinical data from multiple sources. This study analyzed the utility of ontologies beyond their traditional roles, that is, in addressing a challenging and currently underserved field of feature engineering in machine learning workflows. Machine learning workflows are being increasingly used to analyze medical records with heterogeneous phenotypic, genotypic, and related medical terms to improve patient care. We performed a retrospective study using neuropathology reports from the German Neuropathology Reference Center for Epilepsy Surgery at Erlangen, Germany. This cohort included 312 patients who underwent epilepsy surgery and were labeled with one or more diagnoses, including dual pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, malformation of cortical dysplasia, tumor, encephalitis, and gliosis. We modeled the diagnosis terms together with their microscopy, immunohistochemistry, anatomy, etiologies, and imaging findings using the description logic-based Web Ontology Language (OWL) in the Epilepsy and Seizure Ontology (EpSO). Three tree-based machine learning models were used to classify the neuropathology reports into one or more diagnosis classes with and without ontology-based feature engineering. We used five-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting with a fixed number of repetitions while leaving out one subset of data for testing, and we used recall, balanced accuracy, and hamming loss as performance metrics for the multi-label classification task. The epilepsy ontology-based feature engineering approach improved the performance of all the three learning models with an improvement of 35.7\%, 54.5\%, and 33.3\% in logistics regression, random forest, and gradient tree boosting models respectively. The run time performance of all three models improved significantly with ontology-based feature engineering with gradient tree boosting model showing a 93.8\% reduction in the time required for training and testing of the model. Although, all three models showed an overall improved performance across the three-performance metrics using ontology-based feature engineering, the rate of improvement was not consistent across all input features. To analyze this variation in performance, we computed feature importance scores and found that microscopy had the highest importance score across the three models, followed by imaging, immunohistochemistry, and anatomy in a decreasing order of importance scores. This study showed that ontologies have an important role in feature engineering to make heterogeneous clinical data accessible to machine learning models and also improve the performance of machine learning models in multilabel multiclass classification tasks.},

              Objective
              Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with one of the most complex pathogeneses, making effective and clinically actionable decision support difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a novel multimodal deep learning framework to aid medical professionals in AD diagnosis.
            
            
              Materials and Methods
              We present a Multimodal Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis framework (MADDi) to accurately detect the presence of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from imaging, genetic, and clinical data. MADDi is novel in that we use cross-modal attention, which captures interactions between modalities—a method not previously explored in this domain. We perform multi-class classification, a challenging task considering the strong similarities between MCI and AD. We compare with previous state-of-the-art models, evaluate the importance of attention, and examine the contribution of each modality to the model’s performance.
            
            
              Results
              MADDi classifies MCI, AD, and controls with 96.88\% accuracy on a held-out test set. When examining the contribution of different attention schemes, we found that the combination of cross-modal attention with self-attention performed the best, and no attention layers in the model performed the worst, with a 7.9\% difference in F1-scores.
            
            
              Discussion
              Our experiments underlined the importance of structured clinical data to help machine learning models contextualize and interpret the remaining modalities. Extensive ablation studies showed that any multimodal mixture of input features without access to structured clinical information suffered marked performance losses.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This study demonstrates the merit of combining multiple input modalities via cross-modal attention to deliver highly accurate AD diagnostic decision support.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately predict the prognosis and intervention requirements for treating highly infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, can greatly support the effective management of patients, especially in resource-limited settings. The aim of the study is to develop and validate a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) system using clinical findings, laboratory data and AI-interpreted features of chest X-rays (CXRs), and to predict the prognosis and the required interventions for patients diagnosed with COVID-19, using multi-center data. In total, 2282 real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients’ initial clinical findings, laboratory data and CXRs were retrospectively collected from 13 medical centers in South Korea, between January 2020 and June 2021. The prognostic outcomes collected included intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality. Intervention outcomes included the use of oxygen (O2) supplementation, mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). A deep learning algorithm detecting 10 common CXR abnormalities (DLAD-10) was used to infer the initial CXR taken. A random forest model with a quantile classifier was used to predict the prognostic and intervention outcomes, using multimodal data. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) values for the single-modal model, using clinical findings, laboratory data and the outputs from DLAD-10, were 0.742 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.696–0.788), 0.794 (0.745–0.843) and 0.770 (0.724–0.815), respectively. The AUROC of the combined model, using clinical findings, laboratory data and DLAD-10 outputs, was significantly higher at 0.854 (0.820–0.889) than that of all other models (p {\textless} 0.001, using DeLong’s test). In the order of importance, age, dyspnea, consolidation and fever were significant clinical variables for prediction. The most predictive DLAD-10 output was consolidation. We have shown that a multimodal AI model can improve the performance of predicting both the prognosis and intervention in COVID-19 patients, and this could assist in effective treatment and subsequent resource management. Further, image feature extraction using an established AI engine with well-defined clinical outputs, and combining them with different modes of clinical data, could be a useful way of creating an understandable multimodal prediction model.},

              Background
              Low back pain (LBP) is a common condition made up of a variety of anatomic and clinical subtypes. Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) are two subtypes highly associated with LBP. Patients with LDH/LSS are often started with non-surgical treatments and if those are not effective then go on to have decompression surgery. However, recommendation of surgery is complicated as the outcome may depend on the patient’s health characteristics. We developed a deep learning (DL) model to predict decompression surgery for patients with LDH/LSS.
            
            
              Materials and method
              We used datasets of 8387 and 8620 patients from a prospective study that collected data from four healthcare systems to predict early (within 2 months) and late surgery (within 12 months after a 2 month gap), respectively. We developed a DL model to use patients’ demographics, diagnosis and procedure codes, drug names, and diagnostic imaging reports to predict surgery. For each prediction task, we evaluated the model’s performance using classical and generalizability evaluation. For classical evaluation, we split the data into training (80\%) and testing (20\%). For generalizability evaluation, we split the data based on the healthcare system. We used the area under the curve (AUC) to assess performance for each evaluation. We compared results to a benchmark model (i.e. LASSO logistic regression).
            
            
              Results
              For classical performance, the DL model outperformed the benchmark model for early surgery with an AUC of 0.725 compared to 0.597. For late surgery, the DL model outperformed the benchmark model with an AUC of 0.655 compared to 0.635. For generalizability performance, the DL model outperformed the benchmark model for early surgery. For late surgery, the benchmark model outperformed the DL model.
            
            
              Conclusions
              For early surgery, the DL model was preferred for classical and generalizability evaluation. However, for late surgery, the benchmark and DL model had comparable performance. Depending on the prediction task, the balance of performance may shift between DL and a conventional ML method. As a result, thorough assessment is needed to quantify the value of DL, a relatively computationally expensive, time-consuming and less interpretable method.},

In this paper, an automatic overall survival time prediction system (OST) for glioblastoma patients is developed on the basis of radiomic features and machine learning (ML). This system is designed to predict prognosis outcomes by classifying a glioblastoma patient into one of three survival groups: short-term, mid-term, and long-term. To develop the prediction system, a medical dataset based on imaging information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-imaging information is used. A novel radiomic feature extraction method is proposed and developed on the basis of volumetric and location information of brain tumor subregions extracted from MRI scans. This method is based on calculating the volumetric features from two brain sub-volumes obtained from the whole brain volume in MRI images using brain sectional planes (sagittal, coronal, and horizontal). Many experiments are conducted on the basis of various ML methods and combinations of feature extraction methods to develop the best OST system. In addition, the feature fusions of both radiomic and non-imaging features are examined to improve the accuracy of the prediction system. The best performance was achieved by the neural network and feature fusions.},

            While prognosis and risk of progression are crucial in developing precise therapeutic strategy in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), limited predictive tools are available. We proposed a novel deep convolutional neural network that enables feature extraction through image and non-image data integration to seize imperative information and achieve highly accurate outcome prediction. The Heterogeneous Data Fusion Net (HDF-Net) was designed to predict visual acuity (VA) outcome (improvement ≥ 2 line or not) at 12th months after anti-VEGF treatment. A set of pre-treatment optical coherence tomography (OCT) image and non-image demographic features were employed as input data and the corresponding 12th-month post-treatment VA as the target data to train, validate, and test the HDF-Net. This newly designed HDF-Net demonstrated an AUC of 0.989 (95\% CI 0.970–0.999), accuracy of 0.936 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.889–0.964], sensitivity of 0.933 (95\% CI 0.841–0.974), and specificity of 0.938 (95\% CI 0.877–0.969). By simulating the clinical decision process with mixed pre-treatment information from raw OCT images and numeric data, HDF-Net demonstrated promising performance in predicting individualized treatment outcome. The results highlight the potential of deep learning to simultaneously process a broad range of clinical data to weigh and leverage the complete information of the patient. This novel approach is an important step toward real-world personalized therapeutic strategy for typical nAMD.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common, progressive, and currently incurable neurodegenerative movement disorder. The diagnosis of PD is challenging, especially in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism and in early PD detection. Due to the advantages of machine learning such as learning complex data patterns and making inferences for individuals, machine-learning techniques have been increasingly applied to the diagnosis of PD, and have shown some promising results. Machine-learning-based imaging applications have made it possible to help differentiate parkinsonism and detect PD at early stages automatically in a number of neuroimaging studies. Comparative studies have shown that machine-learning-based SPECT image analysis applications in PD have outperformed conventional semi-quantitative analysis in detecting PD-associated dopaminergic degeneration, performed comparably well as experts’ visual inspection, and helped improve PD diagnostic accuracy of radiologists. Using combined multi-modal (imaging and clinical) data in these applications may further enhance PD diagnosis and early detection. To integrate machine-learning-based diagnostic applications into clinical systems, further validation and optimization of these applications are needed to make them accurate and reliable. It is anticipated that machine-learning techniques will further help improve differential diagnosis of parkinsonism and early detection of PD, which may reduce the error rate of PD diagnosis and help detect PD at pre-motor stage to make it possible for early treatments (e.g., neuroprotective treatment) to slow down PD progression, prevent severe motor symptoms from emerging, and relieve patients from suffering.},

              Background
              Images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are crucial unstructured data for prognostic evaluation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We developed and validated a prognostic system based on the MRI features and clinical data of locoregionally advanced NPC (LA-NPC) patients to distinguish low-risk patients with LA-NPC for whom concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is sufficient.
            
            
              Methods
              This multicenter, retrospective study included 3444 patients with LA-NPC from January 1, 2010, to January 31, 2017. A 3-dimensional convolutional neural network was used to learn the image features from pretreatment MRI images. An eXtreme Gradient Boosting model was trained with the MRI features and clinical data to assign an overall score to each patient. Comprehensive evaluations were implemented to assess the performance of the predictive system. We applied the overall score to distinguish high-risk patients from low-risk patients. The clinical benefit of induction chemotherapy (IC) was analyzed in each risk group by survival curves.
            
            
              Results
              We constructed a prognostic system displaying a concordance index of 0.776 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.746 to 0.806) for the internal validation cohort and 0.757 (95\% CI = 0.695 to 0.819), 0.719 (95\% CI = 0.650 to 0.789), and 0.746 (95\% CI = 0.699 to 0.793) for the 3 external validation cohorts, which presented a statistically significant improvement compared with the conventional TNM staging system. In the high-risk group, patients who received induction chemotherapy plus CCRT had better outcomes than patients who received CCRT alone, whereas there was no statistically significant difference in the low-risk group.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The proposed framework can capture more complex and heterogeneous information to predict the prognosis of patients with LA-NPC and potentially contribute to clinical decision making.},

            Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disease without a cure, and current treatment options are limited to symptomatic relief. Prediction of OA progression is a very challenging and timely issue, and it could, if resolved, accelerate the disease modifying drug development and ultimately help to prevent millions of total joint replacement surgeries performed annually. Here, we present a multi-modal machine learning-based OA progression prediction model that utilises raw radiographic data, clinical examination results and previous medical history of the patient. We validated this approach on an independent test set of 3,918 knee images from 2,129 subjects. Our method yielded area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.79 (0.78–0.81) and Average Precision (AP) of 0.68 (0.66–0.70). In contrast, a reference approach, based on logistic regression, yielded AUC of 0.75 (0.74–0.77) and AP of 0.62 (0.60–0.64). The proposed method could significantly improve the subject selection process for OA drug-development trials and help the development of personalised therapeutic plans.},

	abstract = {Anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab is a widely used therapeutic option for recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). Nevertheless, the therapeutic response remains highly heterogeneous among GBM patients with discordant outcomes. Recent data have shown that radiomics, an advanced recent imaging analysis method, can help to predict both prognosis and therapy in a multitude of solid tumours. The objective of this study was to identify novel biomarkers, extracted from MRI and clinical data, which could predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in GBM patients treated with bevacizumab using machine-learning algorithms. In a cohort of 194 recurrent GBM patients (age range 18–80), radiomics data from pre-treatment T2 FLAIR and gadolinium-injected MRI images along with clinical features were analysed. Binary classification models for OS at 9, 12, and 15 months were evaluated. Our classification models successfully stratified the OS. The AUCs were equal to 0.78, 0.85, and 0.76 on the test sets (0.79, 0.82, and 0.87 on the training sets) for the 9-, 12-, and 15-month endpoints, respectively. Regressions yielded a C-index of 0.64 (0.74) for OS and 0.57 (0.69) for PFS. These results suggest that radiomics could assist in the elaboration of a predictive model for treatment selection in recurrent GBM patients.},

In this work, we propose a computerized approach using a contextual embedding and fusion strategy for the large-scale inference of TI-RADS final assessment categories from narrative ultrasound (US) reports.

In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning fusion network, called MultiFuseNet, for cervical dysplasia diagnosis, utilizing multi-modal data from cervical screening results. To exploit the relations among different image modalities, we propose an Attention Mutual-Enhance (AME) module to fuse features of each modality at the feature extraction stage. Specifically, we first develop the Fused Faster R-CNN with AME modules for automatic cervix region detection and fused image feature learning, and then incorporate non-image information into the learning model to jointly learn non-linear correlations among all the modalities. To effectively train the Fused Faster R-CNN, we employ an alternating training scheme. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of 87.4\% (88.6\% sensitivity and 86.1\% specificity) on a large dataset, outperforming the methods using any single modality alone and the known multi-modal methods.},

	abstract = {Various modalities, each with a characteristic feature, have evolved over the years in the medical domain to aid the identification and diagnosis of the diseases. The focus of research in multi modal data analysis in medical domain has been to fuse complimentary information, primarily from images, addressing the great variability arising due to differences in method and time of acquisition. Most of the multi modal image analysis approaches using deep learning are CNN based, using convolution layers for image representation and hence employing early fusion strategy. Additional layers of the deep network are designed depending on the type of input images such as 2D or 3D, X-ray, MRI etc., type of deformations between images, and the target application. In practice, medical images are interpreted in the appropriate clinical context using other relevant data such as patient history and laboratory data. Coalescing information from multiple modalities such as images, structured laboratory data, unstructured narrative data can aid accurate diagnosis and efficient monitoring during treatment. Hence multi modal deep learning models can be used to ingest pixel data along with other structured and textual data to overcome the limitation of image-only models. The proposed work involves detecting type of skin lesion using images and patient clinical data. Experimental results on PAD-UFES-20 dataset verify that combining patient information and image features results in increase of accuracy of detection.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer diagnosis is inherently multimodal. To assess a patient’s cancer status, physicians integrate imaging findings with a variety of clinical risk factor data. Despite this, deep learning approaches for automatic breast cancer classification often only utilize image data or non-image clinical data, but not both simultaneously. In this work, we implemented and compared strategies for the fusion of imaging and tabular non-image data in an end-to-end trainable manner, evaluating fusion at different stages in the model (fusing intermediate features vs. output probabilities) and with different operations (concatenation vs. addition vs. multiplication). This retrospective study utilized dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) data from 10,185 breast MRI examinations of 5,248 women. DCE-MRIs were reduced to 2D maximum intensity projections, split into single-breast images, then linked to a set of 18 non-image features including clinical indication and mam-mographic breast density. We first trained unimodal baseline models on images alone and non-image data alone. We then developed three multimodal fusion models that learn jointly from image and non-image data, evaluating performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and specificity at 95\% sensitivity. The image-only baseline achieved an AUC of 0.849 (95\% CI: 0.834, 0.864) and specificity at 95\% sensitivity of 30.1\% (95\% CI: 23.1\%, 37.0\%), while the best-performing fusion model achieved an AUC of 0.898 (95\% CI: 0.885, 0.909) and specificity of 49.1\% (95\% CI: 38.8\%, 55.3\%). Furthermore, all three fusion methods significantly outperformed both unimodal baselines with respect to AUC and specificity at 95\% sensitivity. This work demonstrates in our dataset for breast cancer classification that incorporating non-image data with images can significantly improve predictive performance and that fusion of intermediate learned features is superior to fusion of final probabilities.},

In the proposed methodology, we used deep learning (DL) based 3D U-shaped Convolutional Neural Network inspired encoder-decoder architecture to segment the brain tumor. Further, feature extraction was performed on these segmented and raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using a pre-trained 2D residual neural network. The dimension-reduced principal components were integrated with clinical data and the handcrafted features of tumor subregions to compare the performance of regression-based automated ML techniques. Through the proposed methodology, we achieved the mean squared error (MSE) of 87 067.328, median squared error of 30 915.66, and a SpearmanR correlation of 0.326 for survival prediction (SP) with the validation set of Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation 2020 dataset. These results made the MSE far better than the existing automated techniques for the same patients. Automated SP of GBM patients is a crucial topic with its relevance in clinical use. The results proved that DL-based feature extraction using 2D pre-trained networks is better than many heavily trained 3D and 2D prediction models from scratch. The ensembled approach has produced better results than single models. The most crucial feature affecting GBM patients' survival is the patient's age, as per the feature importance plots presented in this work. The most critical MRI modality for SP of GBM patients is the T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery, as evident from the feature importance plots.},

	abstract = {Purpose

To develop a multimodal machine learning–based pipeline to predict patient-specific risk of dislocation following primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).

Materials and Methods

This study retrospectively evaluated 17 073 patients who underwent primary THA between 1998 and 2018. A test set of 1718 patients was held out. A hybrid network of EfficientNet-B4 and Swin-B transformer was developed to classify patients according to 5-year dislocation outcomes from preoperative anteroposterior pelvic radiographs and clinical characteristics (demographics, comorbidities, and surgical characteristics). The most informative imaging features, extracted by the mentioned model, were selected and concatenated with clinical features. A collection of these features was then used to train a multimodal survival XGBoost model to predict the individualized hazard of dislocation within 5 years. C index was used to evaluate the multimodal survival model on the test set and compare it with another clinical-only model trained only on clinical data. Shapley additive explanation values were used for model explanation.

Results

The study sample had a median age of 65 years (IQR: 18 years; 52.1\% [8889] women) with a 5-year dislocation incidence of 2\%. On the holdout test set, the clinical-only model achieved a C index of 0.64 (95\% CI: 0.60, 0.68). The addition of imaging features boosted multimodal model performance to a C index of 0.74 (95\% CI: 0.69, 0.78; P = .02).

Conclusion

Due to its discrimination ability and explainability, this risk calculator can be a potential powerful dislocation risk stratification and THA planning tool.

Although the state-of-the-art convolutional networks were applied to solve the classification problem and achieved overall decent prediction results, there is still room for performance improvement, especially for rare disease categories.

Specifically, the metadata information is innovatively applied to control the importance of different types of visual information during diagnosis. Comprehensive experiments with various deep learning model architectures demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed fusion approach especially for relatively rare diseases.

The traditional diagnosis of ADHD relies on the long-term analysis of complex information such as clinical data (electroencephalogram, etc.), patients' behavior and psychological tests by professional doctors. In recent years, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been developing rapidly and is widely employed in the study of brain cognition due to its non-invasive and non-radiation characteristics. We propose an algorithm based on convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDAE) and adaptive boosting decision trees (AdaDT) to improve the results of ADHD classification. Firstly, combining the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the denoising autoencoder (DAE), we developed a convolutional denoising autoencoder to extract the spatial features of fMRI data and obtain spatial features sorted by time. Then, AdaDT was exploited to classify the features extracted by CDAE. Finally, we validate the algorithm on the ADHD-200 test dataset. The experimental results show that our method offers improved classification compared with state-of-the-art methods in terms of the average accuracy of each individual site and all sites, meanwhile, our algorithm can maintain a certain balance between specificity and sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that commonly occurs in the elderly. With the current accelerated aging process, the accurate diagnosis of early AD is essential for patient care and disease delay. In recent years, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in diagnosing AD due to advances in deep learning and neuroimaging technology. This paper proposes a model framework for multi-classification prediction of Alzheimer’s disease based on fusing multi-modal features. Firstly, the sMRI data are pre-processed based on ROI templates with different segmentation accuracy levels to extract morphological features including gray matter volume, surface area and cortical thickness, and then these features are combined with the corresponding Clinical Data to produce the Indicators dataset. Secondly, a 3DCNN-SE module is proposed to extract the primary features from the 3D MRI data. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the Indicators, an Indicator Selection Strategy is designed to select the most relevant features from the Indicators. Finally, a Multi-Attention-Fusion Module (MAFM) is developed to perform multi-modal data fusion on the results of feature extraction and selection, followed by a SoftMax classifier for AD disease diagnosis. We evaluated 596 patients from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI), including 198 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 200 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 198 patients cognitively normal(CN). As a result, 88\% accuracy is achieved on the three classifications, which is better than the related methods mentioned in literature.},

	abstract = {Introduction In small trials, randomization can fail, leading to differences in patient characteristics across treatment arms, a risk that can be reduced by stratifying using key confounders. In ALS trials, riluzole use (RU) and bulbar onset (BO) have been used for stratification. We hypothesized that randomization could be improved by using a multifactorial prognostic score of predicted survival as a single stratifier. Methods We defined a randomization failure as a significant difference between treatment arms on a characteristic. We compared randomization failure rates when stratifying for RU and BO (“traditional stratification”) to failure rates when stratifying for predicted survival using a predictive algorithm. We simulated virtual trials using the PRO-ACT database without application of a treatment effect to assess balance between cohorts. We performed 100 randomizations using each stratification method – traditional and algorithmic. We applied these stratification schemes to a randomization simulation with a treatment effect using survival as the endpoint and evaluated sample size and power. Results Stratification by predicted survival met with fewer failures than traditional stratification. Stratifying predicted survival into tertiles performed best. Stratification by predicted survival was validated with an external dataset, the placebo arm from the BENEFIT-ALS trial. Importantly, we demonstrated a substantial decrease in sample size required to reach statistical power. Conclusions Stratifying randomization based on predicted survival using a machine learning algorithm is more likely to maintain balance between trial arms than traditional stratification methods. The methodology described here can translate to smaller, more efficient clinical trials for numerous neurological diseases.},

	abstract = {Objective: To pool data from completed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) clinical trials and create an open-access resource that enables greater understanding of the phenotype and biology of ALS.
Methods: Clinical trials data were pooled from 16 completed phase II/III ALS clinical trials and one observational study. Over 8 million de-identified longitudinally collected data points from over 8,600 individuals with ALS were standardized across trials and merged to create the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) database. This database includes demographics, family histories, and longitudinal clinical and laboratory data. Mixed effects models were used to describe the rate of disease progression measured by the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and vital capacity (VC). Cox regression models were used to describe survival data. Implementing Bonferroni correction, the critical p value for 15 different tests was p 5 0.003.
Results: The ALSFRS-R rate of decline was 1.02 (62.3) points per month and the VC rate of decline was 2.24\% of predicted (66.9) per month. Higher levels of uric acid at trial entry were predictive of a slower drop in ALSFRS-R (p 5 0.01) and VC (p , 0.0001), and longer survival (p 5 0.02). Higher levels of creatinine at baseline were predictive of a slower drop in ALSFRS-R (p 5 0.01) and VC (p , 0.0001), and longer survival (p 5 0.01). Finally, higher body mass index (BMI) at baseline was associated with longer survival (p , 0.0001).
Conclusion: The PRO-ACT database is the largest publicly available repository of merged ALS clinical trials data. We report that baseline levels of creatinine and uric acid, as well as baseline BMI, are strong predictors of disease progression and survival. Neurology® 2014;83:1719–1725},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00113},
	abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurode-generative disease highly known for its rapid progression, leading to death usually within a few years. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Therefore, efforts must be taken to prevent respiratory insufficiency. Preventive administration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has proven to improve survival in ALS patients. Using disease progression groups revealed to be of great importance to ALS studies, since the heterogeneous nature of disease presentation and progression presents challenges to the learn of predictive models that work for all patients. In this context, we propose an approach to stratify patients in three progression groups (Slow, Neutral and Fast) enabling the creation of specialized learning models that predict the need of NIV within a time window of 90, 180 or 365 days of their current medical appointment. The models are built using a collection of classifiers and 5x10-fold cross validation. We also test the use of a Feature Selection Ensemble to test which features are more relevant to predict this outcome. Our specialized predictive models showed promising results, proving the utility of patient stratification when predicting NIV in ALS patients.},

Since life expectancy is relatively low, it is essential to promptly understand the course of the disease to better target the patient’s treatment. Predictive models for disease progression are thus of great interest. One of the most extensive and well-studied open-access data resources for ALS is the Pooled Resource Open-Access ALS Clinical Trials (PRO-ACT) repository. In 2015, the DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life Challenge was held on PRO-ACT data, where competitors were asked to develop machine learning algorithms to predict disease progression measured through the slope of the ALSFRS score between 3 and 12 months. However, although it has already been successfully applied in several studies on ALS patients, to the best of our knowledge deep learning approaches still remain unexplored on the ALSFRS slope prediction in PRO-ACT cohort. Here, we investigate how deep learning models perform in predicting ALS progression using the PRO-ACT data. We developed three models based on different architectures that showed comparable or better performance with respect to the state-of-the-art models, thus representing a valid alternative to predict ALS disease progression.},

We sought to determine whether there were common patterns of disease progression that could aid in the design and analysis of clinical trials. We developed an approach based on a mixture of Gaussian processes to identify clusters of patients sharing similar disease progression patterns, modeling their average trajectories and the variability in each cluster. We show that ALS progression is frequently nonlinear, with periods of stable disease preceded or followed by rapid decline. We also show that our approach can be extended to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

However, missing features, rater bias and inaccurate measurements are typical ailments of real-life medical datasets. Recently, it has been shown that deep learning with graph convolution neural networks (GCN) can outperform traditional machine learning in disease classification, but missing features remain an open problem. In this work, we follow up on the idea of modeling multi-modal disease classification as a matrix completion problem, with simultaneous classification and non-linear imputation of features. Compared to methods before, we arrange subjects in a graph-structure and solve classification through geometric matrix completion, which simulates a heat diffusion process that is learned and solved with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate the potential of this method on the ADNI-based TADPOLE dataset and on the task of predicting the transition from MCI to Alzheimer’s disease. With an AUC of 0.950 and classification accuracy of 87\%, our approach outperforms standard linear and non-linear classifiers, as well as several state-of-the-art results in related literature, including a recently proposed GCN-based approach.},

Graphs provide a natural framework for such tasks, yet previous graph-based approaches focus on pairwise similarities without modelling the subjects’ individual characteristics and features. On the other hand, relying solely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors fails to model the interaction and similarity between subjects, which can reduce performance. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for brain analysis in populations, combining imaging and non-imaging data. We represent populations as a sparse graph where its vertices are associated with image-based feature vectors and the edges encode phenotypic information. This structure was used to train a GCN model on partially labelled graphs, aiming to infer the classes of unlabelled nodes from the node features and pairwise associations between subjects. We demonstrate the potential of the method on the challenging ADNI and ABIDE databases, as a proof of concept of the benefit from integrating contextual information in classification tasks. This has a clear impact on the quality of the predictions, leading to 69.5\% accuracy for ABIDE (outperforming the current state of the art of 66.8\%) and 77\% for ADNI for prediction of MCI conversion, significantly outperforming standard linear classifiers where only individual features are considered.},

The growing availability of new types of drug features brings the opportunity of learning a more comprehensive and accurate drug similarity that represents the full spectrum of underlying drug relations. However, it is challenging to integrate these heterogeneous, noisy, nonlinear-related information to learn accurate similarity measures especially when labels are scarce. Moreover, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we propose to learn accurate and interpretable similarity measures from multiple types of drug features. In particular, we model the integration using multi-view graph auto-encoders, and add attentive mechanism to determine the weights for each view with respect to corresponding tasks and features for better interpretability. Our model has flexible design for both semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. Experimental results demonstrated significant predictive accuracy improvement.

	doi = {10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102588},
	abstract = {Background:
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterised by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The fact that ALS’s disease course is highly heterogeneous, and its determinants not fully known, combined with ALS’s relatively low prevalence, renders the successful application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques particularly arduous.
Objective:
This systematic review aims at identifying areas of agreement and unanswered questions regarding two notable applications of AI in ALS, namely the automatic, data-driven stratification of patients according to their phenotype, and the prediction of ALS progression. Differently from previous works, this review is focused on the methodological landscape of AI in ALS.
Methods:
We conducted a systematic search of the Scopus and PubMed databases, looking for studies on data-driven stratification methods based on unsupervised techniques resulting in (A) automatic group discovery or (B) a transformation of the feature space allowing patient subgroups to be identified; and for studies on internally or externally validated methods for the prediction of ALS progression. We described the selected studies according to the following characteristics, when applicable: variables used, methodology, splitting criteria and number of groups, prediction outcomes, validation schemes, and metrics.
Results:
Of the starting 1604 unique reports (2837 combined hits between Scopus and PubMed), 239 were selected for thorough screening, leading to the inclusion of 15 studies on patient stratification, 28 on prediction of ALS progression, and 6 on both stratification and prediction. In terms of variables used, most stratification and prediction studies included demographics and features derived from the ALSFRS or ALSFRS-R scores, which were also the main prediction targets. The most represented stratification methods were K-means, and hierarchical and expectation-maximisation clustering; while random forests, logistic regression, the Cox proportional hazard model, and various flavours of deep learning were the most widely used prediction methods. Predictive model validation was, albeit unexpectedly, quite rarely performed in absolute terms (leading to the exclusion of 78 eligible studies), with the overwhelming majority of included studies resorting to internal validation only.
Conclusion:
This systematic review highlighted a general agreement in terms of input variable selection for both stratification and prediction of ALS progression, and in terms of prediction targets. A striking lack of validated models emerged, as well as a general difficulty in reproducing many published studies, mainly due to the absence of the corresponding parameter lists. While deep learning seems promising for prediction applications, its superiority with respect to traditional methods has not been established; there is, instead, ample room for its application in the subfield of patient stratification. Finally, an open question remains on the role of new environmental and behavioural variables collected via novel, real-time sensors.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that severely impairs human thinking and memory. The accurate diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stages, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is very important for timely treatment or possible interventions of AD. Recent studies have shown that multiple neuroimaging and biological measures contain supplementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. Most existing methods are proposed to simply integrate the multimodal data and train the model using all samples once, which do not fully explore the structural information across the different modalities and ignore the significance of sample learning in the training process. In this article, we propose a multimodal self-paced locality-preserving learning (MSLPL) framework to preserve the inherent structural relationships of the original data and realize the sample selection process from “simple” to “complex.” Specifically, the model can project the neuroimaging and genetic data into the label space and learn dimensionality reduction manners with preserving locality structure. Meanwhile, the contributions of each sample are adaptively evaluated by weighting optimization so that the impact of noises can be reduced during model training by self-paced learning (SPL). Finally, a multikernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is used to fuse the features selected from different modalities for the final prediction. We evaluate MSLPL on 913 subjects from the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database with imaging and genetic data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better classification performances compared with the start-of-the-art multimodality-based methods.},

Population graphs, which include multimodal imaging information of the subjects along with the relationships among the population, have been used in literature along with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and have proved beneficial for a variety of medical imaging tasks. A population graph is usually static and constructed manually using non-imaging information. However, graph construction is not a trivial task and might significantly affect the performance of the GCN, which is inherently very sensitive to the graph structure. In this work, we propose a framework that learns a population graph structure optimized for the downstream task. An attention mechanism assigns weights to a set of imaging and non-imaging features (phenotypes), which are then used for edge extraction. The resulting graph is used to train the GCN. The entire pipeline can be trained end-to-end. Additionally, by visualizing the attention weights that were the most important for the graph construction, we increase the interpretability of the graph. We use the UK Biobank, which provides a large variety of neuroimaging and non-imaging phenotypes, to evaluate our method on brain age regression and classification. The proposed method outperforms competing static graph approaches and other state-of-the-art adaptive methods. We further show that the assigned attention scores indicate that there are both imaging and non-imaging phenotypes that are informative for brain age estimation and are in agreement with the relevant literature.},

	abstract = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that often occurs in Southeast Asia and southern China. Since there is a need for a more precise personalized therapy plan that depends on accurate prognosis prediction, it may be helpful to predict patients’ overall survival (OS) based on clinical data. However, most of the current deep learning (DL) based methods which use a single modality fail to effectively utilize amount of multimodal data of patients, causing inaccurate survival prediction. In view of this, we propose a Multimodal Transformer for Survival Prediction (Multi-TransSP) of NPC patients that uses tabular data and computed tomography (CT) images jointly. Taking advantage of both convolutional neural network and Transformer, the architecture of our network is comprised of a multimodal CNN-Based Encoder and a Transformer-Based Encoder. Particularly, the CNN-Based Encoder can learn rich information from specific modalities and the Transformer-Based Encoder is able to fuse multimodal feature. Our model automatically gives the final prediction of OS with a concordance index (CI) of 0.6941 on our in-house dataset, and our model significantly outperforms other methods using any single source of data or previous multimodal frameworks.

	abstract = {Background: The substantial heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and lack of reliable progression markers in Parkinson's disease (PD) present a major challenge in predicting accurate progression and prognoses. Increasing evidence indicates that each component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption may take part in many neurodegenerative diseases. Since some portions of CSF are eliminated along the neurovascular unit and across the BBB, disturbing the pathways may result in changes of these substances.Methods: Four hundred seventy-four participants from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study (NCT01141023) were included in the study. Thirty-six initial features, including general information, brief clinical characteristics and the current year's classical scale scores, were used to build five regression models to predict PD motor progression represented by the coming year's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III score after redundancy removal and recursive feature elimination (RFE)-based feature selection. Then, a threshold range was added to the predicted value for more convenient model application. Finally, we evaluated the CSF and blood biomarkers' influence on the disease progression model.Results: Eight hundred forty-nine cases were included in the study. The adjusted R2 values of three different categories of regression model, linear, Bayesian and ensemble, all reached 0.75. Models of the same category shared similar feature combinations. The common features selected among the categories were the MDS-UPDRS Part III score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder Questionnaire (RBDSQ) score. It can be seen more intuitively that the model can achieve certain prediction effect through threshold range. Biomarkers had no significant impact on the progression model within the data in the study.Conclusions: By using machine learning and routinely gathered assessments from the current year, we developed multiple dynamic models to predict the following year's motor progression in the early stage of PD. These methods will allow clinicians to tailor medical management to the individual and identify at-risk patients for future clinical trials examining disease-modifying therapies.},

	abstract = {Background
Understanding disease progression of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is important for better prognosis and decisions on the appropriate course of treatment to slow down the disease progression.
New Method
We present here an innovative machine learning framework capable of (1) indicating the trajectory of disease progression by identifying relevant imaging biomarkers and (2) automated disease diagnosis. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) have been used for data dimensionality reduction and to reveal potentially useful disease-specific biomarkers, regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs have been used for automated disease diagnosis using Least Square Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) and to delineate disease progression.
Results
A multi-site, multi-scanner dataset containing 1316 MRIs was obtained from ADNI33ADNI: Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative and PPMI: Parkinson’s progression markersinitiative. and PPMI. Identified biomarkers have been used to decipher (1) trajectory of disease progression and (2) identify clinically relevant ROIs. Furthermore, we have obtained a classification accuracy of 94.29 ± 0.08\% and 95.37 ± 0.02\% for distinguishing AD and PD from HC subjects respectively.
Comparison with other existing methods
The goal of this study was fundamentally different from other machine learning based studies for automated disease diagnosis. We aimed to develop a method that has two-fold benefits (1) It can be used to understand pathology of neurodegenerative diseases and (2) It also achieves automated disease diagnosis.
Conclusions
In the absence of established disease biomarkers, clinical diagnosis is heavily prone to misdiagnosis. Being clinically relevant and readily adaptable in the current clinical settings, the developed framework could be a stepping stone to make machine learning based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for neurodegenerative disease diagnosis a reality.},

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a multimodal machine learning model for the prediction of continuous cognitive decline in patients with early PD. We included 213 PD patients from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. Machine learning was used to predict change in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score using the difference between baseline and 4-years follow-up data as outcome. Input features were categorized into four sets: clinical test scores, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, brain volumes, and genetic variants. All combinations of input feature sets were added to a basic model, which consisted of demographics and baseline cognition. An iterative scheme using RReliefF-based feature ranking and support vector regression in combination with tenfold cross validation was used to determine the optimal number of predictive features and to evaluate model performance for each combination of input feature sets. Our best performing model consisted of a combination of the basic model, clinical test scores and CSF-based biomarkers. This model had 12 features, which included baseline cognition, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF total tau, CSF amyloid-beta1-42, geriatric depression scale (GDS) scores, and anxiety scores. Interestingly, many of the predictive features in our model have previously been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, showing the importance of assessing Alzheimer’s disease pathology in patients with Parkinson’s disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose
In Parkinson’s disease (PD), 5–10\% of cases are of genetic origin with mutations identified in several genes such as leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and glucocerebrosidase (GBA). We aim to predict these two gene mutations using hybrid machine learning systems (HMLS), via imaging and non-imaging data, with the long-term goal to predict conversion to active disease.
Methods
We studied 264 and 129 patients with known LRRK2 and GBA mutations status from PPMI database. Each dataset includes 513 features such as clinical features (CFs), conventional imaging features (CIFs) and radiomic features (RFs) extracted from DAT-SPECT images. Features, normalized by Z-score, were univariately analyzed for statistical significance by the t-test and chi-square test, adjusted by Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Multiple HMLSs, including 11 features extraction (FEA) or 10 features selection algorithms (FSA) linked with 21 classifiers were utilized. We also employed Ensemble Voting (EV) to classify the genes.
Results
For prediction of LRRK2 mutation status, a number of HMLSs resulted in accuracies of 0.98 ± 0.02 and 1.00 in 5-fold cross-validation (80\% out of total data points) and external testing (remaining 20\%), respectively. For predicting GBA mutation status, multiple HMLSs resulted in high accuracies of 0.90 ± 0.08 and 0.96 in 5-fold cross-validation and external testing, respectively. We additionally showed that SPECT-based RFs added value to the specific prediction of of GBA mutation status.
Conclusion
We demonstrated that combining medical information with SPECT-based imaging features, and optimal utilization of HMLS can produce excellent prediction of the mutations status in PD patients.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is progressive and heterogeneous. Levodopa is widely prescribed to control PD, and its long-term-treatment leads to dyskinesia in a dose-dependent manner. Interpretation of clinical trials comparing different drug treatments for PD is complicated by different dose intensities employed: higher doses of levodopa produce better symptomatic control but more late complications. Thus, the dose must be recalibrated and reduced gradually. Since recommendations for gradually reducing Levodopa are currently lacking and estimation of Levodopa amount can help doctor to correctly prescribe drug amount, this study aims to predict Levodopa amount and incremental doses using Hybrid Machine Learning Systems (HMLS) and a mixture of radiomics and clinical features. We selected 264 patients from PPMI and obtained 950 features including imaging and nominating features. We generated seven datasets constructed from the dataset in years 0 and 1, which linked with outcomes, (O1) patients being on/off drug in year 1, (O2) dose amount in year 1, and (O3-8) incremental dose from 1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th, 4th to 5th, 1st to 4th, 1st to 5th year. HMLSs included 10 feature extraction/9 feature selection algorithms followed by 10 prediction algorithms. To predict O1, timeless dataset + Random Forest + ReliefA had the highest accuracy 88.5\% ± 2.2\%, and external testing 91.6\%. Furthermore, to predict O2, timeless dataset + Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Algorithm (MRMR) + K Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNN-R) achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) 47.5 ± 13.6 ([30.3:850 milligram]) and external testing 31.9. To predict dose increments (O3-8), HMLSs: Unsupervised Feature Selection with Ordinal Locality + KNNR, ReliefA + KNNR, ReliefA + KNNR, Local Learning-based Clustering Feature Selection + KNNR, MRMR + KNNR, and MRMR + KNNR applied to timeless datasets resulted in MAEs 0.42 ± 0.18, 0.10 ± 0.09, 0.04 ± 0.01, 0.24 ± 0.15, 0.25 ± 0.05, and 0.33 ± 0.26 ([0.23:29.7]), respectively. Moreover, their external testing confirmed our findings.

It is unclear if there are features at diagnosis that predict future DBS surgery. Objective To assess predictors of eventual DBS surgery in de novo PD patients. Methods Subjects from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) database with newly diagnosed, sporadic PD (n = 416) were identified and stratified by their eventual DBS status (DBS+, n = 43; DBS-, n = 373). A total of 50 baseline clinical, imaging, and biospecimen features were extracted for each subject and cross-validated lasso regression was used for feature reduction. Multivariate logistic regression assessed their relationship with DBS status and a receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated model performance. Linear mixed effect models assessed disease progression over 4 years in DBS+ and DBS- patients. Results Age at symptom onset, Hoehn and Yahr (H\&Y) stage, tremor score, and ratio of CSF Tau to amyloid-beta 1–42 (Tau: Ab) were identified as important baseline features for predicting DBS surgery. Each independently predicted DBS surgery (area under the curve = 0.83). DBS- patients had faster memory decline (P {\textless} 0.05), while DBS+ patients had faster decline in H\&Y stage (P {\textless} 0.001) and motor scores (P {\textless} 0.05) prior to surgery. Conclusion The identified features may be used for early identification of patients who may be surgical candidates during the course of their disease. Disease progression in these groups reflects surgical eligibility criteria, with DBS- patients having more rapid decline in memory while DBS+ patients experienced a faster decline in motor scores prior to DBS surgery.},

	abstract = {Personalized medicine promises individualized disease prediction and treatment. The convergence of machine learning (ML) and available multimodal data is key moving forward. We build upon previous work to deliver multimodal predictions of Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk and systematically develop a model using GenoML, an automated ML package, to make improved multi-omic predictions of PD, validated in an external cohort. We investigated top features, constructed hypothesis-free disease-relevant networks, and investigated drug–gene interactions. We performed automated ML on multimodal data from the Parkinson’s progression marker initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinson’s Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Our initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72\% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03\%). Optimizing thresholds for classification increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy and other metrics. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT and PRS contributed most to the predictive power of the model, but the accuracy of these are supplemented by many smaller effect transcripts and risk SNPs. Our model is best suited to identifying large groups of individuals to monitor within a health registry or biobank to prioritize for further testing. This approach allows complex predictive models to be reproducible and accessible to the community, with the package, code, and results publicly available.},

	abstract = {Scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) refers to patients who mimics motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) but showing integrity of dopaminergic system. For this reason, the differential diagnosis between SWEDD and PD patients is often not possible in absence of dopamine imaging. Machine Learning (ML) showed optimal performance in automatically distinguishing these two diseases from clinical and imaging data. However, the most common applied ML algorithms provide high accuracy at expense of findings intelligibility. In this work, a novel ML glass-box model, the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM), based on Generalized Additive Models plus interactions (GA2Ms), was employed to obtain interpretability in classifying PD and SWEDD while still providing optimal performance. Dataset (168 healthy controls, HC; 396 PD; 58 SWEDD) was obtained from PPMI database and consisted of 178 among clinical and imaging features. Six binary EBM classifiers were trained on feature space with (SBR) and without (noSBR) dopaminergic striatal specific binding ratio: HC-PDSBR, HC-SWEDDSBR, PD-SWEDDSBR and HC-PDnoSBR, HC-SWEDDnoSBR, PD-SWEDDnoSBR. Excellent AUC-ROC (1) was reached in classifying HC from PD and SWEDD, both with and without SBR, and by PD-SWEDDSBR (0.986), while PD-SWEDDnoSBR showed lower AUC-ROC (0.882). Apart from optimal accuracies, EBM algorithm was able to provide global and local explanations, revealing that the presence of pairwise interactions between UPSIT Booklet \#1 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale item 3 (ESS3), MDS-UPDRS-III pronation-supination movements right hand (NP3PRSPR) and MDS-UPDRS-III rigidity left upper limb (NP3RIGLU) could provide good performance in predicting PD and SWEDD also without imaging features.},

	abstract = {The description of group-level, genotype- and phenotype-associated imaging traits is academically important, but the practical demands of clinical neurology centre on the accurate classification of individual patients into clinically relevant diagnostic, prognostic and phenotypic categories. Similarly, pharmaceutical trials require the precision stratification of participants based on quantitative measures. A single-centre study was conducted with a uniform imaging protocol to test the accuracy of an artificial neural network classification scheme on a cohort of 378 participants composed of patients with ALS, healthy subjects and disease controls. A comprehensive panel of cerebral volumetric measures, cortical indices and white matter integrity values were systematically retrieved from each participant and fed into a multilayer perceptron model. Data were partitioned into training and testing and receiver-operating characteristic curves were generated for the three study-groups. Area under the curve values were 0.930 for patients with ALS, 0.958 for disease controls, and 0.931 for healthy controls relying on all input imaging variables. The ranking of variables by classification importance revealed that white matter metrics were far more relevant than grey matter indices to classify single subjects. The model was further tested in a subset of patients scanned within 6 weeks of their diagnosis and an AUC of 0.915 was achieved. Our study indicates that individual subjects may be accurately categorised into diagnostic groups in an observer-independent classification framework based on multiparametric, spatially registered radiology data. The development and validation of viable computational models to interpret single imaging datasets are urgently required for a variety of clinical and clinical trial applications.},

Surpassing human-level performance propelled the research in the applications where different modalities amongst language, vision, sensory, text play an important role in accurate predictions and identification. Several multimodal fusion methods employing deep learning models are proposed in the literature. Despite their outstanding performance, the complex, opaque and black-box nature of the deep neural nets limits their social acceptance and usability. This has given rise to the quest for model interpretability and explainability, more so in the complex tasks involving multimodal AI methods. This paper extensively reviews the present literature to present a comprehensive survey and commentary on the explainability in multimodal deep neural nets, especially for the vision and language tasks. Several topics on multimodal AI and its applications for generic domains have been covered in this paper, including the significance, datasets, fundamental building blocks of the methods and techniques, challenges, applications, and future trends in this domain.},

Integration of different data modalities provides opportunities to increase robustness and accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic models, bringing AI closer to clinical practice. AI models are also capable of discovering novel patterns within and across modalities suitable for explaining differences in patient outcomes or treatment resistance. The insights gleaned from such models can guide exploration studies and contribute to the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. To support these advances, here we present a synopsis of AI methods and strategies for multimodal data fusion and association discovery.

Large-scale pre-training multimodal models offer a promising solution, exploiting the burgeoning reservoir of clinical data and amalgamating various data types. This paper delves into unimodal models’ methodologies, applications, and shortcomings while exploring how multimodal models can enhance accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, integrating cutting-edge technologies like federated learning and multi-party privacy computing with AI can substantially mitigate patient privacy concerns in dermatological datasets and further fosters a move towards high-precision self-diagnosis.

This scoping review follows the PRSIMA guidelines and we analysed 46 papers, comprising 11,750 participants, 3569 with AD, 978 with PD, and 2482 healthy controls; the recency of this topic was highlighted by nearly all papers being published in the last 5 years. It highlights the effectiveness of combining different types of data, such as brain scans, cognitive scores, speech and language, gait, hand and eye movements, and genetic assessments for the early detection of AD and PD. The review also outlines the AI methods and the model used in each study, which includes feature extraction, feature selection, feature fusion, and using multi-source discriminative features for classification. The review identifies knowledge gaps around the need to validate findings and address limitations such as small sample sizes.

Crop recommendation for a speciﬁc region is a tedious process as it can be affected by various variables such as soil type and climatic parameters. At the same time, crop yield prediction was based on several features like area, irrigation type, temperature, etc. The recent advancements of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models pave the way to design effective crop recommendation and crop prediction models. In this view, this paper presents a novel Multimodal Machine Learning Based Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction (MMML-CRYP) technique. The proposed MMML-CRYP model mainly focuses on two processes namely crop recommendation and crop prediction. At the initial stage, equilibrium optimizer (EO) with kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) technique is employed for effectual recommendation of crops. Next, random forest (RF) technique was executed for predicting the crop yield accurately. For reporting the improved performance of the MMML-CRYP system, a wide range of simulations were carried out and the results are investigated using benchmark dataset. Experimentation outcomes highlighted the signiﬁcant performance of the MMMLCRYP approach on the compared approaches with maximum accuracy of 97.91\%.},

The use of social media applications and collaborative technologies for information sharing have become increasingly popular.

However, to date, practical Disaster Response (DR) activities are mostly depended on textual information, such as situation reports and email content, and the benefit of other media is often not realised. Deep Learning (DL) algorithms have recently demonstrated promising results in extracting knowledge from multiple modalities of data, but the use of DL approaches for DR tasks has thus far mostly been pursued in an academic context. This paper conducts a systematic review of 83 articles to identify the successes, current and future challenges, and opportunities in using DL for DR tasks. Our analysis is centred around the components of learning, a set of aspects that govern the application of Machine learning (ML) for a given problem domain.

The multimodal data fusion algorithms that process multimodal signals from multimodal sensors to achieve object recognition and decision making are also presented. The challenges and future development of multimodal sensors and data fusion algorithms are further discussed. Advances in these areas open new avenues for advanced robotics applications in human–robot collaboration, rescue missions, garbage sorting, and intelligent prosthetics.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and mobile Internet, the new requirements for human-computer interaction have been put forward. The personalized emotional interaction service is a new trend in the human-computer interaction field. As a basis of emotional interaction, emotion recognition has also introduced many new advances with the development of artificial intelligence. The current research on emotion recognition mostly focuses on single-modal recognition such as expression recognition, speech recognition, limb recognition, and physiological signal recognition. However, the lack of the single-modal emotional information and vulnerability to various external factors lead to lower accuracy of emotion recognition. Therefore, multimodal information fusion for data-driven emotion recognition has been attracting the attention of researchers in the affective computing filed. This paper reviews the development background and hot spots of the data-driven multimodal emotion information fusion. Considering the real-time mental health monitoring system, the current development of multimodal emotion data sets, the multimodal features extraction, including the EEG, speech, expression, text features, and multimodal fusion strategies and recognition methods are discussed and summarized in detail. The main objective of this work is to present a clear explanation of the scientific problems and future research directions in the multimodal information fusion for data-driven emotion recognition field.},

There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance. This survey paper examines primary taxonomy and newly released multimodal fusion architectures. Recent developments in MSA architectures are divided into ten categories, namely early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion, model-level fusion, tensor fusion, hierarchical fusion, bi-modal fusion, attention-based fusion, quantum-based fusion and word-level fusion. A comparison of several architectural evolutions in terms of MSA fusion categories and their relative strengths and limitations are presented. Finally, a number of interdisciplinary applications and future research directions are proposed.},

	abstract = {Rice leaf infections are a common hazard to rice production, affecting many farmers all over the world. Early detection and treatment of rice leaf infection are critical for promoting healthy rice plant growth and ensuring adequate supply for the fast-growing population. Computer-assisted rice leaf disease diagnoses are hampered due to strong image backgrounds. Popular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture extracts the features from images and diagnoses the disease to address the issues above. However, this method is best suitable for segmented images and gives low accuracy with real-time images. In this case, the Internet of Things is a paradigm shift that collects agro-meteorological information that effectively helps diagnose rice diseases. Motivated by the usefulness of CNN models and agricultural IoT, a novel multimodal data fusion framework named Rice-Fusion is proposed to diagnose rice disease. Rice disease diagnosis based on a single modality may not be accurate, and hence the fusion of heterogeneous modalities is essential for robust and reliable disease diagnosis. This gives a new dimension to the domain of rice disease diagnosis. The dataset was collected manually with 3200 rice health category samples using two modalities, namely agro-meteorological sensors and a camera. The Rice-Fusion framework initially extracts the numerical features from agro-meteorological data collected from sensors. Next, it extracts the visual features from the captured rice images. These extracted features are further fused using a concatenation layer followed by a dense layer, which provides single output for diagnosing the rice disease. The testing accuracy of Rice-Fusion is 95.31\% as opposed to other unimodal framework accuracies of 82.03\% and 91.25\% based on CNN and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures, respectively. Experimental results analysis demonstrates that the proposed Rice-Fusion multimodal data fusion framework outperforms the outcome of unimodal frameworks.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review on deep MVL from the following two perspectives: MVL methods in deep learning scope and deep MVL extensions of traditional methods. Specifically, we first review the representative MVL methods in the scope of deep learning, such as multi-view auto-encoder, conventional neural networks and deep brief networks. Then, we investigate the advancements of the MVL mechanism when traditional learning methods meet deep learning models, such as deep multi-view canonical correlation analysis, matrix factorization and information bottleneck. Moreover, we also summarize the main applications, widely-used datasets and performance comparison in the domain of deep MVL. Finally, we attempt to identify some open challenges to inform future research directions.},

	abstract = {Biomedical data are becoming increasingly multimodal and thereby capture the underlying complex relationships among biological processes. Deep learning (DL)-based data fusion strategies are a popular approach for modeling these nonlinear relationships. Therefore, we review the current state-of-the-art of such methods and propose a detailed taxonomy that facilitates more informed choices of fusion strategies for biomedical applications, as well as research on novel methods. By doing so, we find that deep fusion strategies often outperform unimodal and shallow approaches. Additionally, the proposed subcategories of fusion strategies show different advantages and drawbacks. The review of current methods has shown that, especially for intermediate fusion strategies, joint representation learning is the preferred approach as it effectively models the complex interactions of different levels of biological organization. Finally, we note that gradual fusion, based on prior biological knowledge or on search strategies, is a promising future research path. Similarly, utilizing transfer learning might overcome sample size limitations of multimodal data sets. As these data sets become increasingly available, multimodal DL approaches present the opportunity to train holistic models that can learn the complex regulatory dynamics behind health and disease.},

	abstract = {No disease modifying therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found effective to date. To properly power clinical trials for discovery of such therapies, the ability to predict outcome in PD is critical, and there is a significant need for discovery of prognostic biomarkers of PD. Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging is widely used for diagnostic purposes in PD. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate whether longitudinal DAT SPECT imaging can significantly improve prediction of outcome in PD patients. In particular, we investigated whether radiomics analysis of DAT SPECT images, in addition to use of conventional non-imaging and imaging measures, could be used to predict motor severity at year 4 in PD subjects. We selected 64 PD subjects (38 male, 26 female; age at baseline (year 0): 61.9 ± 7.3, range [46,78]) from the Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative (PPMI) database. Inclusion criteria included (i) having had at least 2 SPECT scans at years 0 and 1 acquired on a similar scanner, (ii) having undergone a high-resolution 3 T MRI scan, and (iii) having motor assessment (MDS-UPDRS-III) available in year 4 used as outcome measure. Image analysis included automatic region-of-interest (ROI) extraction on MRI images, registration of SPECT images onto the corresponding MRI images, and extraction of radiomic features. Non-imaging predictors included demographics, disease duration as well as motor and non-motor clinical measures in years 0 and 1. The image predictors included 92 radiomic features extracted from the caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum of DAT SPECT images at years 0 and 1 to quantify heterogeneity and texture in uptake. Random forest (RF) analysis with 5000 trees was used to combine both non-imaging and imaging variables to predict motor outcome (UPDRS-III: 27.3 ± 14.7, range [3,77]). The RF prediction was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Our results demonstrated that addition of radiomic features to conventional measures significantly improved (p {\textless} 0.001) prediction of outcome, reducing the absolute error of predicting MDS-UPDRS-III from 9.00 ± 0.88 to 4.12 ± 0.43. This shows that radiomics analysis of DAT SPECT images has a significant potential towards development of effective prognostic biomarkers in PD.,

However, characterizations of PD are typically made for the “average” patient, ignoring patient heterogeneity and obscuring important individual differences. Modern large-scale data sharing efforts provide a unique opportunity to precisely investigate individual patient characteristics, but there exists no analytic framework for comprehensively integrating data modalities. Here we apply an unsupervised learning method—similarity network fusion—to objectively integrate MRI morphometry, dopamine active transporter binding, protein assays, and clinical measurements from n = 186 individuals with de novo Parkinson’s disease from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We show that multimodal fusion captures inter-dependencies among data modalities that would otherwise be overlooked by field standard techniques like data concatenation. We then examine how patient subgroups derived from the fused data map onto clinical phenotypes, and how neuroimaging data is critical to this delineation. Finally, we identify a compact set of phenotypic axes that span the patient population, demonstrating that this continuous, low-dimensional projection of individual patients presents a more parsimonious representation of heterogeneity in the sample compared to discrete biotypes. Altogether, these findings showcase the potential of similarity network fusion for combining multimodal data in heterogeneous patient populations.},

To leverage the complementary representations of different modalities, multimodal fusion is consequently needed to dig out both inter-modality and intra-modality information. With the exploited rich information, it is becoming popular to combine multiple modality data to explore the structural and functional characteristics of the brain in both health and disease status. In this paper, we first review a wide spectrum of advanced machine learning methodologies for fusing multimodal brain imaging data, broadly categorized into unsupervised and supervised learning strategies. Followed by this, some representative applications are discussed, including how they help to understand the brain arealization, how they improve the prediction of behavioral phenotypes and brain aging, and how they accelerate the biomarker exploration of brain diseases. Finally, we discuss some exciting emerging trends and important future directions.

In this study, we explored the association between Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-derived measures of cortical thickness (CT) and subcortical grey matter (GM) volume with D50 model parameters. T1-weighted MRI images of 72 Healthy Controls (HC) and 100 patients with ALS were analyzed using Surface-based Morphometry for cortical structures and Voxel-based Morphometry for subcortical Region-Of-Interest analyses using the Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12). In Inter-group contrasts, these parameters were compared between patients and HC. Further, the D50 model was used to conduct subgroup-analyses, dividing patients by a) Phase of disease covered at the time of MRI-scan and b) individual overall disease aggressiveness. Finally, correlations between GM and D50 model-derived parameters were examined. Inter-group analyses revealed ALS-related cortical thinning compared to HC located mainly in frontotemporal regions and a decrease in GM volume in the left hippocampus and amygdala. A comparison of patients in different phases showed further cortical and subcortical GM atrophy along with disease progression. Correspondingly, regression analyses identified negative correlations between cortical thickness and individual disease covered. However, there were no differences in CT and subcortical GM between patients with low and high disease aggressiveness. By application of the D50 model, we identified correlations between cortical and subcortical GM atrophy and ALS-related functional disability, but not with disease aggressiveness. This qualifies CT and subcortical GM volume as biomarkers representing individual disease covered to monitor therapeutic interventions in ALS.},

	abstract = {The hypothalamus is a small structure of the brain with an essential role in metabolic homeostasis, sleep regulation, and body temperature control. Some neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and dementia syndromes are reported to be related to hypothalamic volume alterations. Despite its crucial role in human body regulation, neuroimaging studies of this structure are rather scarce due to work-intensive operator-dependent manual delineations from MRI and lack of automated segmentation tools. In this study we present a fully automatic approach based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for hypothalamic segmentation and volume quantification. We applied CNN of U-Net architecture with EfficientNetB0 backbone to allow for accurate automatic hypothalamic segmentation in seconds on a GPU. We further applied our approach for the quantification of the normalized hypothalamic volumes to a large neuroimaging dataset of 432 ALS patients and 112 healthy controls (without the ground truth labels). Using the automated volumetric analysis, we could reproduce hypothalamic atrophy findings associated with ALS by detecting significant volume differences between ALS patients and controls at the group level. In conclusion, a fast and unbiased AI-assisted hypothalamic quantification method is introduced in this study (whose acceptance rate based on the outlier removal strategy was estimated to be above 95\%) and made publicly available for researchers interested in the conduction of hypothalamus studies at a large scale.},

	abstract = {Background
ALS patients with hexanucleotide expansion in C9orf72 are characterized by a specific clinical phenotype, including more aggressive disease course and cognitive decline. Computerized multiparametric MRI with gray matter volumetry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to analyze white matter structural connectivity is a potential in vivo biomarker.
Objective
The objective of this study was to develop a multiparametric MRI signature in a large cohort of ALS patients with C9orf72 mutations. The aim was to investigate how morphological features of C9orf72-associated ALS differ in structural MRI and DTI compared to healthy controls and ALS patients without C9orf72 mutations.
Methods
Atlas-based volumetry (ABV) and whole brain-based DTI-based analyses were performed in a cohort of n = 51 ALS patients with C9orf72 mutations and compared with both n = 51 matched healthy controls and n = 51 C9orf72 negative ALS patients, respectively. Subsequently, Spearman correlation analysis of C9orf72 ALS patients‘ data with clinical parameters (age of onset, sex, ALS-FRS-R, progression rate, survival) as well as ECAS and p-NfH in CSF was performed.
Results
The whole brain voxel-by-voxel comparison of fractional anisotropy (FA) maps between C9orf72 ALS patients and controls showed significant bilateral alterations in axonal structures of the white matter at group level, primarily along the corticospinal tracts and in fibers projecting to the frontal lobes. For the frontal lobes, these alterations were also significant between C9orf72 positive and C9orf72 negative ALS patients. In ABV, patients with C9orf72 mutations showed lower volumes of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobe, with the lowest values in the gray matter of the superior frontal and the precentral gyrus, but also in hippocampi and amygdala. Compared to C9orf72 negative ALS, the differences were shown to be significant for cerebral gray matter (p = 0.04), especially in the frontal (p = 0.01) and parietal lobe (p = 0.01), and in the thalamus (p = 0.004). A correlation analysis between ECAS and averaged regional FA values revealed significant correlations between cognitive performance in ECAS and frontal association fibers. Lower FA values in the frontal lobes were associated with worse performance in all cognitive domains measured (language, verbal fluency, executive functions, memory and spatial perception). In addition, there were significant negative correlations between age of onset and atlas-based volumetry results for gray matter.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates a distinct pattern of DTI alterations of the white matter and ubiquitous volume reductions of the gray matter early in the disease course of C9orf72-associated ALS. Alterations were closely linked to a more aggressive cognitive phenotype. These results are in line with an expected pTDP43 propagation pattern of cortical affection and thus strengthen the hypothesis that an underlying developmental disorder is present in ALS with C9orf72 expansions. Thus, multiparametric MRI could contribute to the assessment of the disease as an in vivo biomarker even in the early phase of the disease.},

	abstract = {IntroductionDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to map disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and therefore is a promising candidate for a biomarker in ALS. To this end, longitudinal study protocols need to be optimized and validated regarding group sizes and time intervals between visits. The objective of this study was to assess the influences of sample size, the schedule of follow-up measurements, and measurement uncertainties on the statistical power to optimize longitudinal DTI study protocols in ALS.Patients and methodsTo estimate the measurement uncertainty of a tract-of–interest-based DTI approach, longitudinal test-retest measurements were applied first to a normal data set. Then, DTI data sets of 80 patients with ALS and 50 healthy participants were analyzed in the simulation of longitudinal trajectories, that is, longitudinal fractional anisotropy (FA) values for follow-up sessions were simulated for synthetic patient and control groups with different rates of FA decrease in the corticospinal tract. Monte Carlo simulations of synthetic longitudinal study groups were used to estimate the statistical power and thus the potentially needed sample sizes for a various number of scans at one visit, different time intervals between baseline and follow-up measurements, and measurement uncertainties.ResultsFrom the simulation for different longitudinal FA decrease rates, it was found that two scans per session increased the statistical power in the investigated settings unless sample sizes were sufficiently large and time intervals were appropriately long. The positive effect of a second scan per session on the statistical power was particularly pronounced for FA values with high measurement uncertainty, for which the third scan per session increased the statistical power even further.ConclusionWith more than one scan per session, the statistical power of longitudinal DTI studies can be increased in patients with ALS. Consequently, sufficient statistical power can be achieved even with limited sample sizes. An improved longitudinal DTI study protocol contributes to the detection of small changes in diffusion metrics and thereby supports DTI as an applicable and reliable non-invasive biomarker in ALS.},

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as a paradigmatic motor neuron disease, has been extensively studied by advanced neuroimaging methods, including molecular imaging by MRI and PET, furthering finer and more specific details of the cascade of ALS neurodegeneration and symptoms, facilitated by multicentric studies implementing novel methodologies. With an increase in multimodal neuroimaging data on ALS and an exponential improvement in neuroimaging technology, the need for harmonization of protocols and integration of their respective findings into a consistent model becomes mandatory. Integration of multimodal data into a model of a continuing cascade of functional loss also calls for the best attempt to correlate the different molecular imaging measurements as performed at the shortest inter-modality time intervals possible. As outlined in this perspective article, simultaneous PET/MRI, nowadays available at many neuroimaging research sites, offers the perspective of a one-stop shop for reproducible imaging biomarkers on neuronal damage and has the potential to become the new gold standard for characterizing motor neuron disease from the clinico-radiological and neuroscientific perspectives.},

In this study, a framework for the longitudinal analysis of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based mapping was applied to the assessment of predefined white matter tracts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as an example for a rapid progressive neurodegenerative disease.Methods: DTI was performed every 3 months in six patients with ALS (mean (M) = 7.7; range 3 to 15 scans) and in six controls (M = 3; range 2–5 scans) with the identical scanning protocol, resulting in a total of 65 longitudinal DTI datasets. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axonal diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and the ratio AD/RD were studied to analyze alterations within the corticospinal tract (CST) which is a prominently affected tract structure in ALS and the tract correlating with Braak’s neuropathological stage 1. A correlation analysis was performed between progression rates based on DTI metrics and the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS-R).Results: Patients with ALS showed an FA and AD/RD decline along the CST, while DTI metrics of controls did not change in longitudinal DTI scans. The FA and AD/RD decrease progression correlated significantly with ALS-FRS-R decrease progression.Conclusion: On the basis of the longitudinal assessment, DTI-based metrics can be considered as a possible noninvasive follow-up marker for disease progression in neurodegeneration. This finding was demonstrated here for ALS as a fast progressing neurodegenerative disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Damage to the cerebral tissue structural connectivity associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which extends beyond the motor pathways, can be visualised by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The effective translation of DTI metrics as biomarker requires its application across multiple MRI scanners and patient cohorts. A multicentre study was undertaken to assess structural connectivity in ALS within a large sample size.
METHODS: 442 DTI data sets from patients with ALS (N=253) and controls (N=189) were collected for this retrospective study, from eight international ALS-specialist clinic sites. Equipment and DTI protocols varied across the centres. Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the control participants were used to establish correction matrices to pool data, and correction algorithms were applied to the FA maps of the control and ALS patient groups.
RESULTS: Analysis of data pooled from all centres, using whole-brain-based statistical analysis of FA maps, confirmed the most significant alterations in the corticospinal tracts, and captured additional significant white matter tract changes in the frontal lobe, brainstem and hippocampal regions of the ALS group that coincided with postmortem neuropathological stages. Stratification of the ALS group for disease severity (ALS functional rating scale) confirmed these findings.
INTERPRETATION: This large-scale study overcomes the challenges associated with processing and analysis of multiplatform, multicentre DTI data, and effectively demonstrates the anatomical fingerprint patterns of changes in a DTI metric that reflect distinct ALS disease stages. This success paves the way for the use of DTI-based metrics as read-out in natural history, prognostic stratification and multisite disease-modifying studies in ALS.},

	abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging can identify amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated patterns of brain alterations at the group level. Recently, a neuropathological staging system for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has shown that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may disseminate in a sequential regional pattern during four disease stages. The objective of the present study was to apply a new methodological diffusion tensor imaging-based approach to automatically analyse in vivo the fibre tracts that are prone to be involved at each neuropathological stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Two data samples, consisting of 130 diffusion tensor imaging data sets acquired at 1.5 T from 78 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 52 control subjects; and 55 diffusion-tensor imaging data sets at 3.0 T from 33 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 22 control subjects, were analysed by a tract of interest-based fibre tracking approach to analyse five tracts that become involved during the course of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: the corticospinal tract (stage 1); the corticorubral and the corticopontine tracts (stage 2); the corticostriatal pathway (stage 3); the proximal portion of the perforant path (stage 4); and two reference pathways. The statistical analyses of tracts of interest showed differences between patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects for all tracts. The significance level of the comparisons at the group level was lower, the higher the disease stage with corresponding involved fibre tracts. Both the clinical phenotype as assessed by the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale-revised and disease duration correlated significantly with the resulting staging scheme. In summary, the tract of interest-based technique allowed for individual analysis of predefined tract structures, thus making it possible to image in vivo the disease stages in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This approach can be used not only for individual clinical work-up purposes, but enlarges the spectrum of potential non-invasive surrogate markers as a neuroimaging-based read-out for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis studies within a clinical context.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate progressive white matter (WM) degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: Sixty-six patients with ALS and 43 healthy controls were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study in the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC). Participants underwent a harmonized neuroimaging protocol across 4 centers that included diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment of WM integrity. Three visits were accompanied by clinical assessments of disability (ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised [ALSFRS-R]) and upper motor neuron (UMN) function. Voxel-wise whole-brain and quantitative tract-wise DTI assessments were done at baseline and longitudinally. Correction for site variance incorporated data from healthy controls and from healthy volunteers who underwent the DTI protocol at each center.
RESULTS: Patients with ALS had a mean progressive decline in fractional anisotropy (FA) of the corticospinal tract (CST) and frontal lobes. Tract-wise analysis revealed reduced FA in the CST, corticopontine/corticorubral tract, and corticostriatal tract. CST FA correlated with UMN function, and frontal lobe FA correlated with the ALSFRS-R score. A progressive decline in CST FA correlated with a decline in the ALSFRS-R score and worsening UMN signs. Patients with fast vs slow progression had a greater reduction in FA of the CST and upper frontal lobe.
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive WM degeneration in ALS is most prominent in the CST and frontal lobes and, to a lesser degree, in the corticopontine/corticorubral tracts and corticostriatal pathways. With the use of a harmonized imaging protocol and incorporation of analytic methods to address site-related variances, this study is an important milestone toward developing DTI biomarkers for cerebral degeneration in ALS.

The aim of this review is to summarize recent progress in the development of MRI-based techniques aiming to support the clinical diagnosis in ALS.Areas covered: The review of structural and functional MRI applications to ALS and its variants (restricted phenotypes) is focused on the potential of MRI techniques which contribute to the diagnostic work-up of patients with the clinical presentation of a motor neuron disease. The potential of specific MRI methods for patient diagnosis and monitoring is discussed, and the future design of clinical MRI applications to ALS is conceptualized.Expert opinion: Current multiparametric MRI allows for the use as a clinical biological marker and a technical instrument in the clinical diagnosis of patients with ALS and also of patients with ALS variants. Composite neuroimaging indices of specific anatomical areas derived from different MRI techniques might guide in the diagnostic applications to ALS. Such a development of ALS-specific MRI-based composite scores with sufficient discriminative power versus ALS mimics at an individual level requires standardized advanced protocols and comprehensive analysis approaches.},

	abstract = {This study addresses Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. ALS patients experience motor weakness, atrophy, spasticity, and difﬁculty in speech, swallowing, and breathing. Predicting ALS survival and progression is crucial for tailored care, interventions, and informed decision-making. Utilising the PRO-ACT database and Exonhit Therapeutics’ clinical trial data, machine learning may allow predicting disease progression based on ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores and patient survival within one year of follow-up. To comprehensively understand patient proﬁles, unsupervised learning via UMAP was applied for dimension reduction, effectively grouping patients based on features. To optimise the predictive quality of our models, we selected features prior to the analysis process. Ridge regression combined with feature selection yielded a predictive quality of 80.32\% for patients’ survival and UMAP achieved prediction rates from 67.93\% when considering all clusters to 92.75\% when focusing on the most homogeneous ones, emphasising the relevance of feature selection. Our method showed accurate performance in predicting ALSFRS score progression at 3 months (RMSE = 2.86 and Adjusted R² = 0.796). This study demonstrates the ability of the models to provide meaningful predictive insights in the speciﬁc context of ALS, enhancing the understanding of disease dynamics and facilitating personalised patient care.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis, stratification and monitoring of disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis currently rely on clinical history and examination. The phenotypic heterogeneity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including extramotor cognitive impairments is now well recognized. Candidate biomarkers have shown variable sensitivity and specificity, and studies have been mainly undertaken only cross-sectionally. Sixty patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (without a family history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or dementia) underwent baseline multimodal magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Grey matter pathology was identified through analysis of T1-weighted images using voxel-based morphometry. White matter pathology was assessed using tract-based spatial statistics analysis of indices derived from diffusion tensor imaging. Cross-sectional analyses included group comparison with a group of healthy controls (n = 36) and correlations with clinical features, including regional disability, clinical upper motor neuron signs and cognitive impairment. Patients were offered 6-monthly follow-up MRI, and the last available scan was used for a separate longitudinal analysis (n = 27). In cross-sectional study, the core signature of white matter pathology was confirmed within the corticospinal tract and callosal body, and linked strongly to clinical upper motor neuron burden, but also to limb disability subscore and progression rate. Localized grey matter abnormalities were detected in a topographically appropriate region of the left motor cortex in relation to bulbar disability, and in Broca's area and its homologue in relation to verbal fluency. Longitudinal analysis revealed progressive and widespread changes in the grey matter, notably including the basal ganglia. In contrast there was limited white matter pathology progression, in keeping with a previously unrecognized limited change in individual clinical upper motor neuron scores, despite advancing disability. Although a consistent core white matter pathology was found cross-sectionally, grey matter pathology was dominant longitudinally, and included progression in clinically silent areas such as the basal ganglia, believed to reflect their wider cortical connectivity. Such changes were significant across a range of apparently sporadic patients rather than being a genotype-specific effect. It is also suggested that the upper motor neuron lesion in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be relatively constant during the established symptomatic period. These findings have implications for the development of effective diagnostic versus therapeutic monitoring magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may be characterized initially by a predominantly white matter tract pathological signature, evolving as a widespread cortical network degeneration.},

All participants underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment and the ECAS. Performance at neuropsychological assessment across five domains (fluency, executive function, language, memory and visuospatial function) was compared to the ECAS ALS-Specific (fluency, executive functions and social cognition, language), ALS Non-specific (memory, visuospatial functions), and Total scores. Data from the healthy controls produced population-based abnormality cut-offs: composite score performance ≤ 2 SD in any domain classified impairment at neuropsychological assessment. Thirty-three percent of patients were impaired, most commonly in a single domain (executive or language dysfunction). Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analyses using ECAS Total scores and ALS-Specific scores revealed 85\% sensitivity and 85\% specificity in the detection of cognitive impairment characteristic of ALS (fluency, executive function, language). A five-point borderline range produced optimal values (ALS-Specific Score 77–82, and ECAS-Total Score 105–110). In conclusion, validation against gold standard extensive neuropsychology demonstrated that the ECAS is a screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity to impairment characteristic of ALS.},

The ECAS, a 15-20-min screen, includes an ALS-Specific score (executive functions and social cognition; fluency; language); an ALS Non-specific score (memory; visuospatial functions); and a carer behaviour screen of five domains characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Data from healthy controls produced abnormality cut-offs of 77/100 ALS-Specific score; 24/36 ALS Non-specific score; 105/136 ECAS Total. Twenty-nine percent of patients showed abnormal ALS-Specific scores, and 6\% also showed abnormal ALS Non-specific scores. The most prevalent deficit occurred in language functions (35\%) followed by executive functions and fluency (23\% each). Forty percent of carers reported behaviour change in at least one domain, while 15\% met criteria for possible FTD. In conclusion, the ECAS is an effective within-clinic assessment for ALS that determines the presence, severity and type of cognitive and/or behavioural changes, an essential first step to managing these symptoms.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To see whether the distribution patterns of phosphorylated 43kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) intraneuronal inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) permit recognition of neuropathological stages.
METHODS: pTDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on 70 μm sections from ALS autopsy cases (N = 76) classified by clinical phenotype and genetic background.
RESULTS: ALS cases with the lowest burden of pTDP-43 pathology were characterized by lesions in the agranular motor cortex, brainstem motor nuclei of cranial nerves V, VII, and X-XII, and spinal cord α-motoneurons (stage 1). Increasing burdens of pathology showed involvement of the prefrontal neocortex (middle frontal gyrus), brainstem reticular formation, precerebellar nuclei, and the red nucleus (stage 2). In stage 3, pTDP-43 pathology involved the prefrontal (gyrus rectus and orbital gyri) and then postcentral neocortex and striatum. Cases with the greatest burden of pTDP-43 lesions showed pTDP-43 inclusions in anteromedial portions of the temporal lobe, including the hippocampus (stage 4). At all stages, these lesions were accompanied by pTDP-43 oligodendroglial aggregates. Ten cases with C9orf72 repeat expansion displayed the same sequential spreading pattern as nonexpansion cases but a greater regional burden of lesions, indicating a more fulminant dissemination of pTDP-43 pathology.
INTERPRETATION: pTDP-43 pathology in ALS possibly disseminates in a sequential pattern that permits recognition of 4 neuropathological stages consistent with the hypothesis that pTDP-43 pathology is propagated along axonal pathways. Moreover, the finding that pTDP-43 pathology develops in the prefrontal cortex as part of an ongoing disease process could account for the development of executive cognitive deficits in ALS.},

	abstract = {Background: Cross-sectional imaging studies offer valuable pathological insights into the neurodegenerative changes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, clinical trials urgently require sensitive monitoring markers that can detect subtle progressive changes over relatively short periods of time. We have conducted a three time-point longitudinal study to explore anatomical patterns of disease spread and to determine whether MRI metrics capture longitudinal changes over four and eight-month intervals. Methods: Thirty-two ALS patients were enrolled into a multiparametric imaging study to evaluate progressive cortical thickness, grey matter density and white matter alterations. Whole-brain and region-of-interest analyses were conducted in the precentral gyrus, corticospinal tracts, corpus callosum and cerebellum. Additionally, pre-symptomatic changes were explored in patients with no bulbar or lower limb disability. Results: Our findings suggest that considerable white matter degeneration can be detected early in the course of the disease which shows limited progression over time, whereas grey matter pathology is relatively limited at baseline and exhibits relentless progression. Moreover, progressive presymptomatic structural changes can be identified in the bulbar and lower limb representations of the precentral gyrus. Conclusions: Our longitudinal imaging study confirms that MRI metrics readily capture progressive changes in ALS. Our data also indicate that white matter metrics are of potential use as diagnostic markers, and grey matter measures may be superior as monitoring biomarkers. One of the most interesting findings of our study is the gradually progressive cerebellar grey matter degeneration throughout the three time-points.},

	abstract = {Background
While neuroimaging in ALS has gained unprecedented momentum in recent years, little progress has been made in the development of viable diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring markers.
Objectives
To identify and discuss the common pitfalls in ALS imaging studies and to reflect on optimal study designs based on pioneering studies.
Methods
A “PubMed”-based literature search on ALS was performed based on neuroimaging-related keywords. Study limitations were systematically reviewed and classified so that stereotypical trends could be identified.
Results
Common shortcomings, such as relatively small sample sizes, statistically underpowered study designs, lack of disease controls, poorly characterised patient cohorts and a large number of conflicting studies, remain a significant challenge to the field. Imaging data of ALS continue to be interpreted at a group-level, as opposed to meaningful individual-patient inferences.
Conclusions
A systematic, critical review of ALS imaging has identified stereotypical shortcomings, the lessons of which should be considered in the design of future prospective MRI studies. At a time when large multicentre studies are underway a candid discussion of these factors is particularly timely.},

	abstract = {This paper examines diagnostic timelines for people suspected of having ALS/MND over a 20-year period, evaluates the impact of a ‘fast track’ diagnostic process and discusses typical causes of diagnostic delay. Key diagnostic timelines (dates of first symptom, diagnosis and death) were reviewed for people diagnosed between 1989 and 2008. Patients evaluated through a fast-track diagnostic process and those investigated through traditional neurology clinics were compared. Typical causes of diagnostic delay were investigated. Results showed that diagnostic timelines have been surprisingly consistent over this 20-year period. Time from first symptom to diagnosis hovered around 12 months, with the diagnosis typically being made around the midpoint (50\% of total disease duration elapsed) of the disease pathway. The introduction of a fast-track process has not to date affected overall performance but has shortened times from referral to diagnosis. Diagnostic delays appear to be associated with clinical complexity and delays in referral, both within primary and secondary care services. In conclusion, more widespread implementation of fast-track processes could potentially reduce diagnostic delays. Educational interventions among health care professionals both in primary and secondary care may also help shorten diagnostic pathways.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prognostic implications of cognitive impairment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not established.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the survival effect of the comorbid frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and to determine whether, in the absence of dementia, impairment in different cognitive domains affects outcome.
METHODS: A prospective population-based study of incident cases of ALS in the Republic of Ireland included home-based neuropsychological assessments using age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. Four cognitive domains were evaluated: executive function, memory, language, and visuospatial skills.
RESULTS: Mean age of the participants (n = 139) was 63.3 years; 61.2\% were male and 35.3\% had bulbar-onset ALS. Factors associated with shorter survival included age more than 60, severe disability at baseline, shorter delay to diagnosis, and early respiratory involvement. Comorbid FTD was associated with significantly shorter survival time (hazard ratio [HR] 2.67, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-6.85, p = 0.041). In patients with ALS without dementia, the presence of executive dysfunction was significantly associated with shorter survival. This was confirmed in a multivariate model that included age, delay to diagnosis, disease severity at baseline, education, and respiratory status (HR 3.44, 95\% CI 1.45-8.18, p = 0.005). In the absence of executive dysfunction, single or multi-domain impairment in other cognitive domains had no significant effect on survival.
CONCLUSION: Comorbid frontotemporal dementia is a negative prognostic indicator. In patients with ALS without dementia, executive dysfunction, but not impairment in other cognitive domains, is an important negative prognostic indicator.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis currently receive non-invasive ventilation (NIV), reflecting clinical uncertainty about the role of this intervention. We aimed to assess the effect of NIV on quality of life and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: 92 of 102 eligible patients participated. They were assessed every 2 months and randomly assigned to NIV (n=22) or standard care (n=19) when they developed either orthopnoea with maximum inspiratory pressure less than 60\% of that predicted or symptomatic hypercapnia. Primary validated quality-of-life outcome measures were the short form 36 mental component summary (MCS) and the sleep apnoea quality-of-life index symptoms domain (sym). Both time maintained above 75\% of baseline (T(i)MCS and T(i)sym) and mean improvement (microMCS and microsym) were measured.
FINDINGS: NIV improved T(i)MCS, T(i)sym, microMCS, microsym, and survival in all patients and in the subgroup with better bulbar function (n=20). This subgroup showed improvement in several measures of quality of life and a median survival benefit of 205 days (p=0.006) with maintained quality of life for most of this period. NIV improved some quality-of-life indices in those with poor bulbar function, including microsym (p=0.018), but conferred no survival benefit.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis without severe bulbar dysfunction, NIV improves survival with maintenance of, and improvement in, quality of life. The survival benefit from NIV in this group is much greater than that from currently available neuroprotective therapy. In patients with severe bulbar impairment, NIV improves sleep-related symptoms, but is unlikely to confer a large survival advantage.},

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD001447.pub3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Riluzole is approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in most countries. Questions persist about its clinical utility because of high cost and modest efficacy.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the efficacy of riluzole in prolonging survival and in delaying the use of surrogates (tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation) to sustain survival, and to assess the effect of riluzole upon functional health.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 April 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2011), EMBASE (1980 to May 2011) and made enquiries of authors of trials, Aventis (manufacturer of riluzole) and other experts in the field.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: randomized controlled trials
TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: adults with a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Types of interventions: treatment with riluzole or placebo Types of outcome measures: Primary: pooled hazard ratio of tracheostomy-free survival over all time points with riluzole 100 mg. Secondary: per cent mortality with riluzole 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg; neurologic function, muscle strength and adverse events.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One author performed data extraction and two other authors checked them. One author checked the data and entered them into the computer. The other authors verified the data entry. We obtained missing data from the trial authors whenever possible.
MAIN RESULTS: The four trials examining tracheostomy-free survival included a total of 974 riluzole-treated patients and 503 placebo-treated patients. No new randomized controlled trials were found when we updated the searches for this update in 2011. The methodological quality was acceptable and three trials were easily comparable, although one trial (169 participants) included older patients in more advanced stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and one (195 participants) had multiple primary endpoints. Riluzole 100 mg per day provided a benefit for the homogeneous group of patients in the first two trials (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95\% confidence internal (CI) 0.64 to 0.99, P= 0.042) and there was no evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.33). When the third trial (which included older and more seriously affected patients) was added, there was evidence of heterogeneity (P {\textless} 0.0001) and the overall treatment effect was reduced but still significant (HR 0.84, 95\% CI 0.698 to 0.997, P= 0.046). This represented a 9\% gain in the probability of surviving one year (49\% in the placebo and 58\% in the riluzole group), and increased median survival from 11.8 to 14.8 months. There was a small beneficial effect on both bulbar and limb function, but not on muscle strength. A three-fold increase in serum alanine transferase was more frequent in riluzole-treated patients than controls (mean difference 2.62, 95\% CI 1.59 to 4.31).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Riluzole 100 mg daily is reasonably safe and probably prolongs median survival by about two to three months in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins in affected motor neurons. Recent studies have identified several new molecular constituents of ALS-linked cellular aggregates, including FUS, TDP-43, OPTN, UBQLN2 and the translational product of intronic repeats in the gene C9ORF72. Mutations in the genes encoding these proteins are found in a subgroup of ALS patients and segregate with disease in familial cases, indicating a causal relationship with disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, these proteins are often detected in aggregates of non-mutation carriers and those observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, supporting a widespread role in neuronal degeneration. The molecular characteristics and distribution of different types of protein aggregates in ALS can be linked to specific genetic alterations and shows a remarkable overlap hinting at a convergence of underlying cellular processes and pathological effects. Thus far, self-aggregating properties of prion-like domains, altered RNA granule formation and dysfunction of the protein quality control system have been suggested to contribute to protein aggregation in ALS. The precise pathological effects of protein aggregation remain largely unknown, but experimental evidence hints at both gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms. Here, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the molecular make-up, formation, and mechanism-of-action of protein aggregates in ALS. Further insight into protein aggregation will not only deepen our understanding of ALS pathogenesis but also may provide novel avenues for therapeutic intervention.},

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered a multifactorial, multisystem neurodegenerative disease due to an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. This systematic review aims at gathering all available evidence on the association between physical activity (PA) and the risk of ALS.
Methods
Relevant literature published up to January 2015 was gathered through structured searches on Medline, The Cochrane Library, and the ISI Web of Science databases. Studies considering any type of PA as the main exposure and a diagnosis of ALS or motor neuron disease were selected. Data were extracted in standardized forms, and the quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
Results
Bibliographic searches yielded 3168 records. Nineteen case control studies and 7 cohort studies met the inclusion criteria, and were included in the analysis. Evidence on cumulative measures of PA as a risk factor for ALS remain inconclusive. However, cohort studies report a significantly higher number of cases of ALS in professional soccer and American football players, and a slightly increased risk of ALS in varsity athletes.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons with a median survival of 2 years. Most patients have no family history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but current understanding of such diseases suggests there should be an increased risk to relatives. Furthermore, it is a common question to be asked by patients and relatives in clinic. We therefore set out to determine the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to first degree relatives of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis attending a specialist clinic. Case records of patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen at a tertiary referral centre over a 16-year period were reviewed, and pedigree structures extracted. All individuals who had originally presented with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but who subsequently had an affected first degree relative, were identified. Calculations were age-adjusted using clinic population demographics. Probands (n = 1502), full siblings (n = 1622) and full offspring (n = 1545) were identified. Eight of the siblings and 18 offspring had developed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The unadjusted risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis over the observation period was 0.5\% for siblings and 1.0\% for offspring. Age information was available for 476 siblings and 824 offspring. For this subset, the crude incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was 0.11\% per year (0.05–0.21\%) in siblings and 0.11\% per year (0.06–0.19\%) in offspring, and the clinic age-adjusted incidence rate was 0.12\% per year (0.04–0.21\%) in siblings. By age 85, siblings were found to have an 8-fold increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in comparison to the background population. In practice, this means the risk of remaining unaffected by age 85 dropped from 99.7\% to 97.6\%. Relatives of people with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have a small but definite increased risk of being affected.},

There is an assumption that there is a genetic component to all ALS, but genome-wide association studies have yet to produce a robustly replicated result. A definitive estimate of ALS heritability is therefore required to determine whether ongoing efforts to find susceptibility genes are worth while.
METHODS: The authors performed two twin studies, one population- and one clinic-based. The authors used structural equation modelling to perform a meta-analysis of data from these studies and an existing twin study to estimate ALS heritability, and identified 171 twin pairs in which at least one twin had ALS.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Five monozygotic twin pairs were concordant-affected, and 44 discordant-affected. No dizygotic twin pairs were concordant-affected, and 122 discordant-affected. The heritability of sporadic ALS was estimated as 0.61 (0.38 to 0.78) with the unshared environmental component 0.39 (0.22 to 0.62).

Improved prognosis, such as the ENCALS survival model, could inform the patient and their family about disease course and improve end of life planning. Novel staging and scoring systems can help monitor ALS patients’ disease progression and may potentially serve as clinical trial outcomes. Lastly, new tools like biofluid markers, imaging modalities, and neuromuscular electrophysiological measurements may increase diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.

Subsequent symptoms were more often in the contralateral limb following unilateral limb onset (ALS: arms p = 1.05 × 10−8, legs p {\textless} 2.86 × 10−15; LMN phenotype: arms p = 6.74 × 10−9, legs p = 6.26 × 10−6; UMN phenotype: legs p = 4.07 × 10−14). In patients with limb onset, symptoms occurred significantly faster in the contralateral limb, followed by the other limbs and lastly by the bulbar region. Patterns of non-contiguous symptom development were also reported: leg symptoms followed bulbar onset in 30\%, and bulbar symptoms followed leg onset in 11\% of ALS patients. Conclusions: Preferred spread of symptoms from one limb to the contralateral limb, and to adjacent sites appears to be a characteristic of MND phenotypes, suggesting that symptom spread is organized, possibly involving axonal connectivity. Non-contiguous symptom development, however, is not uncommon, and may involve other factors.},

	abstract = {Objective Cognitive impairment is a common, far-reaching but imperceptible manifestation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to identify the risk factors for cognitive impairment in ALS.
Methods We searched PubMed and EMBASE for cross-sectional, case–control and cohort studies that reported predictors of cognitive impairment in ALS. The obtained data were meta-analysed to generate overall ORs and 95\% CIs.
Results Twenty-seven eligible articles reporting on 6799 individuals were included out of 20 501 records. Nine predictors were identified: C9orf72 (OR 3.62, 95\% CI 1.76 to 7.45), dysarthria (OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.20 to 4.22), family history of ALS (OR 1.76, 95\% CI 1.18 to 2.61), predominant upper motor neuron (PUMN) phenotype (OR 1.73, 95\% CI 1.09 to 2.73) and bulbar onset (OR 1.54, 95\% CI 1.28 to 1.87) increased risk factors for cognitive impairment in ALS. ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised scores, sex, age or education level were not significantly associated with cognitive impairment in ALS. In addition, C9orf72 (OR=5.94) and bulbar onset (OR=2.08) were strong predictors of ALS-frontotemporal dementia. Female sex conferred more susceptibility to executive cognitive impairment than male sex (OR=1.82).
Conclusions Patients with C9orf72 repeat expansion, dysarthria, family history of ALS, PUMN phenotype and bulbar onset had a high risk for cognitive impairment in ALS. These associations may contribute to understanding the heterogeneity of ALS.

There is a substantial body of literature connecting military service to ALS. We aimed to summarize and assess the quality of this evidence. Methods Systematic review of the literature, including observational studies which explored one of the following exposures: general military service (army, air force, marines, or navy); or specific exposures associated with military service measured among military personnel. The outcome of interest was ALS incidence, which could include onset, diagnosis, or death from ALS. Results A total of 2642 articles were screened. Following exclusion, 19 articles remained for inclusion in the systematic review, including 1 meta-analysis and 18 original observational studies. Most studies were of moderate quality. In general, the relationship between military service was suggestive of an increased risk, particularly among Gulf War and WWII veterans. Exposure to pesticides (including Agent Orange) certain chemicals (exhaust, burning agents), heavy metals, and head trauma appeared to increase the risk of ALS among military personnel. Conclusions There is a possible association between military service and the subsequent development of ALS; however, the evidence was limited. Studies were generally hindered by small sample sizes and inadequate follow-up time. Future studies should endeavor to objectively measure specific exposures, or combinations thereof, associated with military service, as this will be of vital importance in implementing preventative strategies into military organizations.},

	abstract = {Background
To assess the worldwide variation of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) incidence, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based data published to date.

Methods
We reviewed Medline and Embase up to June 2015 and included all population-based studies of newly diagnosed ALS cases, using multiple sources for case ascertainment. ALS crude and standardized incidence (on age and sex using the US 2010 population) were calculated. Random effect meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using the subcontinent as the main study level covariate. Sources of heterogeneity related to the characteristics of the study population and the study methodology were investigated.

Results
Among 3216 records, 44 studies were selected, covering 45 geographical areas in 11 sub-continents. A total of 13 146 ALS cases and 825 million person-years of follow-up (PYFU) were co-nsidered. The overall pooled worldwide crude ALS incidence was at 1.75 (1.55–1.96)/100 000 PYFU; 1.68 (1.50–1.85)/100 000 PYFU after standardization. Heterogeneity was identified in ALS standardized incidence between North Europe [1.89 (1.46–2.32)/100 000 PYFU] and East Asia [0.83 (0.42–1.24)/100 000 PYFU, China and Japan P = 0.001] or South Asia [0.73 (0.58–0.89)/100 000/PYFU Iran, P = 0.02]. Conversely, homogeneous rates have been reported in populations from Europe, North America and New Zealand [pooled ALS standardized incidence of 1.81 (1.66-1.97)/100 000 PYFU for those areas].

Conclusion
This review confirms a heterogeneous distribution worldwide of ALS, and sets the scene to sustain a collaborative study involving a wide international consortium to investigate the link between ancestry, environment and ALS incidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A noticeable change of the male-to-female sex ratio (SR) has been observed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) leading to an apparent regression of SR with time (SR close to 1:1).
OBJECTIVE: To provide a global SR estimate and investigate its relation with respect to population age.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted including only population-based studies with a high-quality methodology in European ancestral origin population. Male-to-female SR was estimated by three different measures: SR number, SR crude incidence and SR standardized incidence. Standard and dose-response meta-analyses were performed to assess the pooled SR measures (irrespective of population age) and the evolution of the SR measures with respect to population age, respectively. Potential sources of heterogeneity were investigated via meta-regression.
RESULTS: Overall, 3254 articles were retrieved in the literature search. Thirty-nine studies stratified by time periods were included. The overall pooled male-to-female ratio was 1.28 (95\% CI 1.23-1.32) for SR number, 1.33 (95\% CI 1.29-1.38) for SR crude incidence and 1.35 (95\% CI 1.31-1.40) for SR standardized incidence. The SR number with respect to population age reveals a progressive reduction of SR at increasing age, while the SR crude incidence in relation to age displays a U-shaped curve.
CONCLUSIONS: The number and the incidence of ALS cases were consistently higher in males than females. Dose-response meta-analysis showed that SR measures change with respect to population age. Further original research is needed to clarify if our findings are reproducible in other populations.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine the long-term survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and identify predictors of prolonged survival in a population-based cohort of newly diagnosed patients. Methods An incident cohort from a population-based registry during the years 1998 through 2002 in Lombardy, Italy was followed until death or to February 28, 2013. Age, sex, date of onset of symptoms, site of onset, date of diagnosis, and El Escorial diagnostic category were collected. Survival was assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves. Cox proportional hazards function was used to identify independent prognostic predictors. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to assess the 5-year and 10-year excess mortality of ALS patients. Results Included were 280 men and 203 women aged 18 to 93 years. Spinal onset ALS was present in 312 cases (64.6\%). Definite ALS was diagnosed in 213 cases (44.1\%), probable ALS in 130 (26.9\%), possible ALS in 93 (19.3\%), and suspected ALS in 47 (9.7\%). The cumulative time-dependent survival at 1, 5, and 10 years from diagnosis was 76.2\%, 23.4\%, and 11.8\%, respectively. Independent predictors included younger age, the diagnosis of possible/suspected ALS, spinal onset, and symptoms having started {\textgreater}12 months previously at diagnosis. SMR was 9.4 at 5 years and 5.4 at 10 years. SMR at 10 years was higher until age 75 year, predominating in women, and became nonsignificant for males thereafter. Interpretation The outcome in ALS varies with phenotype. Longer survival is predicted by younger age, spinal onset, male gender, and suspected ALS. After age 75 years, 10-year survival in men with ALS is similar to the general population. Ann Neurol 2014;75:287–297},

	abstract = {Cognitive impairment is present in approximately 30\% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and, especially when severe, has a negative impact on survival and caregiver burden. Our 2010 meta-analysis of the cognitive profile of ALS showed impairment of fluency, executive function, language and memory. However, the limited number of studies resulted in large confidence intervals. To obtain a more valid assessment, we updated the meta-analysis and included methodological improvements (controlled data extraction, risk of bias analysis and effect size calculation of individual neuropsychological tests). Embase, Medline and PsycInfo were searched for neuropsychological studies of non-demented patients with ALS and age-matched and education-matched healthy controls. Neuropsychological tests were categorised in 13 cognitive domains and effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated for each domain and for individual tests administered in ≥5 studies. Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the influence of clinical and demographic variables. Forty-four studies were included comprising 1287 patients and 1130 healthy controls. All cognitive domains, except visuoperceptive functions, showed significant effect sizes compared to controls. Cognitive domains without bias due to motor impairment showed medium effect sizes (95\% CI): fluency (0.56 (0.43 to 0.70)), language (0.56 (0.40 to 0.72)), social cognition (0.55 (0.34 to 0.76)), or small effect sizes: delayed verbal memory 0.47 (0.27 to 0.68)) and executive functions (0.41 (0.27 to 0.55)). Individual neuropsychological tests showed diverging effect sizes, which could be explained by bias due to motor impairment. Subgroup analyses showed no influence of bulbar disease onset and depression and anxiety on the cognitive outcomes. The cognitive profile of ALS consists of deficits in fluency, language, social cognition, executive functions and verbal memory. Social cognition is a new cognitive domain with a relatively large effect size, highlighting the overlap between ALS and frontotemporal dementia. The diverging effect sizes for individual neuropsychological tests show the importance of correction for motor impairment in patients with ALS. These findings have implications for bedside testing, the design of cognitive screening measures and full neuropsychological examinations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the relationship between disease stage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), as measured with the King's Clinical Staging System, and cognitive and behavioral change, measured with the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS).
METHODS: A large multicenter observational cohort of 161 cross-sectional patients with ALS and 80 healthy matched controls were recruited across 3 research sites (Dublin, Edinburgh, and London). Participants were administered the ECAS and categorized into independent groups based on their King's clinical disease stage at time of testing.
RESULTS: Significant differences were observed between patients and controls on all subtests of the ECAS except for visuospatial functioning. A significant cross-sectional effect was observed across disease stages for ALS-specific functions (executive, language, letter fluency) and ECAS total score but not for ALS-nonspecific functions (memory, visuospatial). Rates of ALS-specific impairment and behavioral change were also related to disease stage. The relationship between cognitive function and disease stage may be due to letter fluency impairment, whereas higher rates of all behavioral domains were seen in later King's stage. The presence of bulbar signs, but not site of onset, was significantly related to ALS-specific, ECAS total, and behavioral scores.
CONCLUSION: ALS-specific cognitive deficits and behavioral impairment are more frequent with more severe disease stage. By end-stage disease, only a small percentage of patients are free of neuropsychological impairment. The presence of bulbar symptoms exaggerates the differences observed between disease stages. These findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral change should be incorporated into ALS diagnostic criteria and should be included in future staging systems.},

The diagnosis is made based on clinical history, typical exam findings, and diagnostic testing negative for other causes of upper motor neuron dysfunction. EMG is normal, or only shows mild neurogenic findings in a few muscles, not meeting El Escorial criteria. Although no test is specific for PLS, some neurodiagnostic tests are supportive: including absent or delayed central motor conduction times; and changes in the precentral gyrus or corticospinal tracts on MRI, DTI or MR Spectroscopy. Treatment is largely supportive, and includes medications for spasticity, baclofen pump, and treatment for pseudobulbar affect.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) is clinically characterized by signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction and may evolve into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Whether PMA is actually a form of ALS has important consequences clinically and for therapeutic trials. We compared the survival of patients with PMA or ALS to analyze the clinical features that influence survival in PMA.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients with PMA (n = 91) or ALS (n = 871) from our ALS Center and verified survival by telephoning the families or using the National Death Index.
RESULTS: In PMA, patients were more likely to be male (p {\textless} 0.001), older (p = 0.007), and lived longer (p = 0.01) than in ALS. Cox model analysis suggested that the risk of death increased with age at onset in both patient groups (p {\textless} 0.005). Upper motor neuron (UMN) signs developed in 22\% of patients with PMA within 61 months after diagnosis. Demographic and other clinical variables did not differ at diagnosis between those who did or did not develop UMN signs. In PMA, the factors present at diagnosis that predicted shorter survival were greater number of body regions affected, lower forced vital capacity, and lower ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score. Noninvasive ventilation and gastrostomy were used frequently in PMA.
CONCLUSION: Although patients with progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) tended to live longer than those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), shorter survival in PMA is associated with the same risk factors that predict poor survival in ALS. Additionally, PMA is relentlessly progressive, and UMN involvement can occur, as also reported in imaging and postmortem studies. For these reasons, PMA should be considered a form of ALS.},

OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence-based or expert recommendations for the diagnosis and management of ALS based on a literature search and the consensus of an expert panel.
METHODS: All available medical reference systems were searched, and original papers, meta-analyses, review papers, book chapters and guidelines recommendations were reviewed. The final literature search was performed in February 2011. Recommendations were reached by consensus.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Patients with symptoms suggestive of ALS should be assessed as soon as possible by an experienced neurologist. Early diagnosis should be pursued, and investigations, including neurophysiology, performed with a high priority. The patient should be informed of the diagnosis by a consultant with a good knowledge of the patient and the disease. Following diagnosis, the patient and relatives/carers should receive regular support from a multidisciplinary care team. Medication with riluzole should be initiated as early as possible. Control of symptoms such as sialorrhoea, thick mucus, emotional lability, cramps, spasticity and pain should be attempted. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding improves nutrition and quality of life, and gastrostomy tubes should be placed before respiratory insufficiency develops. Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation also improves survival and quality of life. Maintaining the patient's ability to communicate is essential. During the entire course of the disease, every effort should be made to maintain patient autonomy. Advance directives for palliative end-of-life care should be discussed early with the patient and carers, respecting the patient's social and cultural background.},

Although great advances have been made in our understanding of the genetic causes of ALS, the contribution of environmental factors has been more difficult to assess. Large-scale studies of the clinical patterns of ALS, individual histories preceding the onset of ALS, and the rates of ALS in different populations and groups have led to improved patient care, but have not yet revealed a replicable, definitive environmental risk factor. In this Review, we outline what is currently known of the environmental and genetic epidemiology of ALS, describe the current state of the art with respect to the different types of ALS, and explore whether ALS should be considered a single disease or a syndrome. We examine the relationship between genetic and environmental risk factors, and propose a disease model in which ALS is considered to be the result of environmental risks and time acting on a pre-existing genetic load, followed by an automatic, self-perpetuating decline to death.},

Methods: Disease stage was derived retrospectively for each system from the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised subscores using standard methods. The two staging methods were then compared for timing of stages using box plots, correspondence using chi-square tests, agreement using a linearly weighted kappa coefficient and concordance using Spearman’s rank correlation. Results: For both systems, progressively higher stages occurred at progressively later proportions of the disease course, but the distribution differed between the two methods. King’s stage 3 corresponded to MiToS stage 1 most frequently, with earlier King’s stages 1 and 2 largely corresponding to MiToS stage 0 or 1. The Spearman correlation was 0.54. There was fair agreement between the two systems with kappa coefficient of 0.21. Conclusion: The distribution of timings shows that the two systems are complementary, with King’s staging showing greatest resolution in early to mid-disease corresponding to clinical or disease burden, and MiToS staging having higher resolution for late disease, corresponding to functional involvement. We therefore propose using both staging systems when describing ALS.},

Riluzole, a synthetic benzothiazole drug with glutamine antagonist activity, is indicated for the treatment of patients with ALS and is the only drug that has been shown to slow the course of the disease and extend survival in ALS patients.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Staging of disease severity is useful for prognosis, decision-making and resource planning. However, no commonly used, validated staging system exists for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Our purpose was to develop an ALS staging system (ALS Milano-Torino Staging) that captures the observed progressive loss of independence and function.
METHODS: Clinical milestones in ALS progression were defined by loss of independence in four key domains on the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS): swallowing, walking/self-care, communicating and breathing. Stages were defined as follows: stage 0, functional involvement but no loss of independence on any domain; stages 1-4, number of domains in which independence was lost; and stage 5, death. Staging criteria were applied to patients enrolled in a Quality of Care in ALS (QOC) study; endpoints included function (ALSFRS), quality of life (QOL; Short Form-36) and health service costs. Between-stage transition probabilities were assessed in the QOC study and in a second clinical study of lithium carbonate in ALS.
RESULTS: 70/118 (59.3\%) participants in the QOC study progressed to higher stages of disease at 12 months compared with their baseline stage. Functional (ALSFRS) and QOL measures were inversely related to disease stage. Health service costs were directly related to increasing disease stages from 0 to 4 (p{\textless}0.001). Probabilities for transitioning from a given stage at baseline in both studies were usually greatest for the next highest stage.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ALS Milano-Torino Staging system correlates well with assessments of function, QOL and health service costs. Further studies are warranted to validate this system.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons, with a median survival of 2-3 years. Although various phenotypic and research diagnostic classification systems exist and several prognostic models have been generated, there is no staging system. Staging criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would help to provide a universal and objective measure of disease progression with benefits for patient care, resource allocation, research classifications and clinical trial design. We therefore sought to define easily identified clinical milestones that could be shown to occur at specific points in the disease course, reflect disease progression and impact prognosis and treatment. A tertiary referral centre clinical database was analysed, consisting of 1471 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen between 1993 and 2007. Milestones were defined as symptom onset (functional involvement by weakness, wasting, spasticity, dysarthria or dysphagia of one central nervous system region defined as bulbar, upper limb, lower limb or diaphragmatic), diagnosis, functional involvement of a second region, functional involvement of a third region, needing gastrostomy and non-invasive ventilation. Milestone timings were standardized as proportions of time elapsed through the disease course using information from patients who had died by dividing time to a milestone by disease duration. Milestones occurred at predictable proportions of the disease course. Diagnosis occurred at 35\% through the disease course, involvement of a second region at 38\%, a third region at 61\%, need for gastrostomy at 77\% and need for non-invasive ventilation at 80\%. We therefore propose a simple staging system for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stage 1: symptom onset (involvement of first region); Stage 2A: diagnosis; Stage 2B: involvement of second region; Stage 3: involvement of third region; Stage 4A: need for gastrostomy; and Stage 4B: need for non-invasive ventilation. Validation of this staging system will require further studies in other populations, in population registers and in other clinic databases. The standardized times to milestones may well vary between different studies and populations, although the stages themselves and their meanings are likely to remain unchanged.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS in a real-world clinical setting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, propensity score-matched cohort study conducted between June 2017 and March 2020 at 12 academic ALS referral centers associated with the German Motor Neuron Disease Network. Of 1440 patients screened, 738 were included in propensity score matching. Final analyses included 324 patients with ALS comprising 194 patients who started intravenous edaravone treatment (141 received ≥4 consecutive treatment cycles; 130 matched) and 130 propensity score-matched patients with ALS receiving standard therapy. All patients had probable or definite ALS according to the El Escorial criteria, with disease onset between December 2012 and April 2019. Subgroups were defined by applying the MCI186-ALS19 study inclusion criteria to evaluate whether patients would have been considered eligible (EFAS) or ineligible (non-EFAS).
EXPOSURES: Intravenous edaravone plus riluzole vs riluzole only.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient characteristics and systematic safety assessment for patients who received at least 1 dose of intravenous edaravone. Effectiveness assessment of edaravone was conducted among patients who received at least 4 treatment cycles compared with propensity score-matched patients with ALS who received only standard therapy. Primary outcome was disease progression measured by decrease in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score. Secondary outcomes were survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression before vs during treatment. To account for the matched design, patients receiving edaravone and their corresponding matched controls were regarded as related samples in disease progression analyses; stratification for propensity score quintiles was used for survival probability and time to ventilation analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 194 patients started intravenous edaravone treatment; 125 (64\%) were male, and the median age was 57.5 years (IQR, 50.7-63.8 years). Potential adverse effects were observed in 30 cases (16\%), most notably infections at infusion sites and allergic reactions. Disease progression among 116 patients treated for a median of 13.9 months (IQR, 8.9-13.9 months) with edaravone did not differ from 116 patients treated for a median of 11.2 months (IQR, 6.4-20.0 months) with standard therapy (ALSFRS-R points/month, -0.91 [95\% CI, -0.69 to -1.07] vs -0.85 [95\% CI, -0.66 to -0.99]; P = .37). No significant differences were observed in the secondary end points of survival probability, time to ventilation, and change in disease progression. Similarly, outcomes between patients treated with edaravone and matched patients did not differ within the EFAS and non-EFAS subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study using propensity score matching found that, although long-term intravenous edaravone therapy for patients with ALS was feasible and mainly well tolerated, it was not associated with any disease-modifying benefit. Intravenous edaravone may not provide a clinically relevant additional benefit compared with standard therapy alone.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the determinants of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) phenotypes in a population-based cohort.
METHODS: The study population included 2,839 patients with ALS diagnosed in Piemonte, Italy (1995-2015). Patients were classified according to motor (classic, bulbar, flail arm, flail leg, predominantly upper motor neuron [PUMN], respiratory) and cognitive phenotypes (normal, ALS with cognitive impairment [ALSci], ALS with behavioral impairment [ALSbi], ALSci and ALSbi combined [ALScbi], ALS-frontotemporal dementia [FTD]). Binary logistic regression analysis was adjusted for sex, age, and genetics.
RESULTS: Bulbar phenotype correlated with older age (p {\textless} 0.0001), women were more affected than men at increasing age (p {\textless} 0.0001), classic with younger age (p = 0.029), men were more affected than women at increasing age (p {\textless} 0.0001), PUMN with younger age (p {\textless} 0.0001), flail arm with male sex (p {\textless} 0.0001) and younger age (p = 0.04), flail leg with male sex with increasing age (p = 0.008), and respiratory with male sex (p {\textless} 0.0001). C9orf72 expansions correlated with bulbar phenotype (p {\textless} 0.0001), and were less frequent in PUMN (p = 0.041); SOD1 mutations correlated with flail leg phenotype (p {\textless} 0.0001), and were less frequent in bulbar (p {\textless} 0.0001). ALS-FTD correlated with C9orf72 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and bulbar phenotype (p = 0.008), ALScbi with PUMN (p = 0.014), and ALSci with older age (p = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the spatial-temporal combination of motor and cognitive events leading to the onset and progression of ALS is characterized by a differential susceptibility to the pathologic process of motor and prefrontal cortices and lower motor neurons, and is influenced by age, sex, and gene variants. The identification of those factors that regulate ALS phenotype will allow us to reclassify patients into pathologically homogenous subgroups, responsive to targeted personalized therapies.},

Since the publication of the Strong criteria, there have been considerable advances in the understanding of the neuropsychological profile of patients with ALS. Not only is the breadth and depth of neuropsychological findings broader than previously recognised – – including deficits in social cognition and language – but mixed deficits may also occur. Evidence now shows that the neuropsychological deficits in ALS are extremely heterogeneous, affecting over 50\% of persons with ALS. When present, these deficits significantly and adversely impact patient survival. It is the recognition of this clinical heterogeneity in association with neuroimaging, genetic and neuropathological advances that has led to the current re-conceptualisation that neuropsychological deficits in ALS fall along a spectrum. These revised consensus criteria expand upon those of 2009 and embrace the concept of the frontotemporal spectrum disorder of ALS (ALS-FTSD).},

We have explored the characteristics of total ALSFRS-R, and ALSFRS-R subscores in longitudinal and survival models, to determine whether subscore analysis enhances the precision of the instrument.
METHODS: All cases with ALSFRS-R scores on the Irish ALS register were included. ALSFRS-R subscores were defined for bulbar, motor and respiratory domains. Longitudinal models were used to visualise fitted total ALSFRS-R and ALSFRS-R subscore progression. In addition, the prognostic value of convenience and computed ALSFRS-R slope and subscore slopes were compared.
RESULTS: 407 incident cases were identified with a complete ALSFRS-R measure. 233 (57\%) patients were male, and 125 (31\%) had bulbar-onset disease. ALSFRS-R bulbar and motor subscore slopes provided a better fit in prognostic models when combined over the total ALSFRS-R slope. Longitudinal analysis revealed that the ALSFRS-R motor subscore deteriorated earlier in spinal-onset disease over bulbar-onset disease, while in bulbar-onset disease the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscore deteriorated earlier and faster than in spinal-onset disease.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis builds on previous knowledge of ALSFRS-R subscores. Decline in ALSFRS-R motor subscores in patients with spinal-onset disease, and decline in ALSFRS-R bulbar subscores in patients with bulbar-onset disease, may predate reported disease onset dates. Respiratory subscores were not prognostically informative after adjustment for bulbar and motor subscores. These results provide robust evidence that the ALSFRS-R should not be reported as a single combined score, but rather as domain specific subscores.},

	abstract = {Objective: The ALSFRS-R is limited by multidimensionality, which originates from the summation of various subscales. This prevents a direct comparison between patients with identical total scores. We aim to evaluate how multidimensionality affects the performance of the ALSFRS-R in clinical trials. Methods: We simulated clinical trial data with different treatment effects for the ALSFRS-R total score and its subscales (i.e. bulbar, fine motor, gross motor and respiratory). We considered scenarios where treatment reduced the rate of ALSFRS-R subscale decline either uniformly (i.e. all subscales respond identically to treatment) or non-uniformly (i.e. subscales respond differently to treatment). Two main analytical strategies were compared: (1) analyzing only the total score or (2) utilizing a subscale-based test (i.e. alternative strategy). For each analytical strategy, we calculated the empirical power and required sample size. Results: Both strategies are valid when there is no treatment benefit and provide adequate control of type 1 error. If all subscales respond identically to treatment, using the total score is the most powerful approach. As the differences in treatment responses between subscales increase, the more the total score becomes affected. For example, to detect a 40\% reduction in the bulbar rate of decline with 80\% power, the total score requires 1380 patients, whereas this is 336 when using the alternative strategy. Conclusions: Ignoring the multidimensional structure of the ALSFRS-R total score could have negative consequences for ALS clinical trials. We propose determining treatment benefit on a subscale level, prior to stating whether a treatment is generally effective.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients tend to develop progressive respiratory muscle weakness, leading to ventilatory failure and ineffective cough, principal causes of morbidity and mortality. Since patients are usually unaware of these symptoms, these are generally not noticed until the advanced stages and are associated with poor prognosis. The monitoring of respiratory function on a regular basis is therefore of great importance. Despite the availability of several pulmonary function tests, none of them was found to be the best indicator of the disease progression throughout the course of this condition. The main aim of our work was to evaluate the prognostic value of these respiratory measures evaluated in a brief period of observation and their correlation with motor functional impairments in an ALS cohort.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with ALS who had respiratory assessments performed and functional motor scales administered at baseline and six months later were included. All patients were assessed with forced vital capacity, both in seated and supine position (FVC; sFVC), peak expiratory flow (PEF), peak expiratory cough flow (PCEF), the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), at baseline and after six months, and their disease progression rate (ΔFS) was obtained.
RESULTS: We included 73 patients with probable or definite ALS according to El-Escorial revised Criteria. At baseline, PCEF and PEF significantly correlated with ALSFRS-R total, bulbar and spinal subscores and ΔFS, while FVC\% significantly correlated with ΔFS. After 6 months all the respiratory parameters significantly correlated with ALSFRS-R and all its subscores. Longitudinally, FVC\%, sFVC\% and PCEF significantly correlated with ΔFS and some of ALSFRS-R subscores. As concerns the survival analysis, monthly declines of FVC\% and sFVC\%, significantly correlated with the survival. The worse prognosis in terms of survival was finally found in those whose FVC\% and sFVC\% dropped below their respective cut-offs.
CONCLUSION: Throughout the course of ALS disease, the monitoring of several respiratory markers, namely FVC, sFVC, PEF and PCEF, plays a critical role in predicting the prognosis of these subjects, both in terms of survival and functional ability. The implementation of monthly cut-offs in the evaluation of FVC and sFVC may allow a faster recognition of those patients with worse prognosis and therefore an optimized tailored clinical care, as well as a better stratification in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate neurodegenerative and inflammatory biomarkers in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PALS), evaluate their predictive value for ALS progression rates, and assess their utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers for monitoring treatment effects.
METHODS: De-identified, longitudinal plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from PALS (n = 108; 85 with samples from ≥2 visits) and controls without neurological disease (n = 41) were obtained from the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) Biofluid Repository. Seventeen of 108 PALS had familial ALS, of whom 10 had C9orf72 mutations. Additional healthy control CSF samples (n = 35) were obtained from multiple sources. We stratified PALS into fast- and slow-progression subgroups using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised change rate. We compared cytokines/chemokines and neurofilament (NF) levels between PALS and controls, among progression subgroups, and in those with C9orf72 mutations.
RESULTS: We found significant elevations of cytokines, including MCP-1, IL-18, and neurofilaments (NFs), indicators of neurodegeneration, in PALS versus controls. Among PALS, these cytokines and NFs were significantly higher in fast-progression and C9orf72 mutation subgroups versus slow progressors. Analyte levels were generally stable over time, a key feature for monitoring treatment effects. We demonstrated that CSF/plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) levels may predict disease progression, and stratification by NFL levels can enrich for more homogeneous patient groups.
INTERPRETATION: Longitudinal stability of cytokines and NFs in PALS support their use for monitoring responses to immunomodulatory and neuroprotective treatments. NFs also have prognostic value for fast-progression patients and may be used to select similar patient subsets in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objective
Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.

Methods
Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.

Results
We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.

Interpretation
Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:725–738},

	abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are rare neurodegenerative diseases with no effective treatment. The development of biomarkers allowing an accurate assessment of disease progression is crucial for evaluating new therapies. Concretely, neuroimaging and transcriptomic (microRNA) data have been shown useful in tracking their progression. However, no single biomarker can accurately measure progression in these complex diseases. Additionally, large samples are not available for such rare disorders. It is thus essential to develop methods that can model disease progression by combining multiple biomarkers from small samples. In this paper, we propose a new framework for computing a disease progression score (DPS) from cross-sectional multimodal data. Specifically, we introduce a supervised multimodal variational autoencoder that can infer a meaningful latent space, where latent representations are placed along a disease trajectory. A score is computed by orthogonal projections onto this path. We evaluate our framework with multiple synthetic datasets and with a real dataset containing 14 patients, 40 presymptomatic genetic mutation carriers and 37 controls from the PREV-DEMALS study. There is no ground truth for the DPS in real-world scenarios, therefore we use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a proxy metric. Results with the synthetic datasets support this choice, since the higher the AUC, the more accurate the predicted simulated DPS. Experiments with the real dataset demonstrate better performance in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed framework thus leverages cross-sectional multimodal datasets with small sample sizes to objectively measure disease progression, with potential application in clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic management and research in Amyotrophic Laterals Sclerosis (ALS) have been limited by the substantial heterogeneity in progression and anatomical spread that are endemic of the disease. Neuroimaging biomarkers represent powerful additions to the current monitoring repertoire but have yielded inconsistent associations with clinical scores like the ALS functional rating scale. The D50 disease progression model was developed to address limitations with clinical indices and the difficulty obtaining longitudinal data in ALS. It yields overall disease aggressiveness as time taken to reach halved functionality (D50); individual disease covered in distinct phases; and calculated functional state and calculated functional loss as acute descriptors of local disease activity. It greatly reduces the noise of the ALS functional rating scale and allows the comparison of highly heterogeneous disease and progression subtypes. In this study, we performed Voxel-Based Morphometry for 85 patients with ALS (60.1 ± 11.5 years, 36 female) and 62 healthy controls. Group-wise comparisons were performed separately for gray matter and white matter using ANCOVA testing with threshold-free cluster enhancement. ALS-related widespread gray and white matter density decreases were observed in the bilateral frontal and temporal lobes (p {\textless} 0.001, family-wise error corrected). We observed a progressive spread of structural alterations along the D50-derived phases, that were primarily located in frontal, temporal and occipital gray matter areas, as well as in supratentorial neuronal projections (p {\textless} 0.001 family-wise error corrected). ALS patients with higher overall disease aggressiveness (D50 {\textless} 30 months) showed a distinct pattern of supratentorial white matter density decreases relative to patients with lower aggressiveness; no significant differences were observed for gray matter density (p {\textless} 0.001 family-wise error corrected). The application of the D50 disease progression model separates measures of disease aggressiveness from disease accumulation. It revealed a strong correlation between disease phases and in-vivo measures of cerebral structural integrity. This study underscores the proposed corticofugal spread of cerebral pathology in ALS. We recommend application of the D50 model in studies linking clinical data with neuroimaging correlates.},

We describe the application of a machine-learned tool that incorporates clinical features and cortical thickness from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images to estimate the time until a composite respiratory failure event for ALS patients, and presents the prediction as individual survival distributions (ISDs). These ISDs provide the probability of survival (none of the respiratory failures) at multiple future time points, for each individual patient. Our learner considers several survival prediction models, and selects the best model to provide predictions. We evaluate our learned model using the mean absolute error margin (MAE-margin), a modified version of mean absolute error that handles data with censored outcomes. We show that our tool can provide helpful information for patients and clinicians in planning future treatment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) presents with varying degrees of brain degeneration that can extend beyond the corticospinal tract (CST). Furthermore, the clinical course and progression of ALS varies widely. Brain degeneration detected using structural MRI could reflect disease progression.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: On study registration, 3-Tesla volumetric MRI and diffusion tensor imaging scans were obtained at baseline in 38 healthy controls and 67 patients with sporadic ALS. Patients had Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores of ≥36 and did not have the chromosome 9, open reading frame 72 repeat expansion. Six months later, changes in ALSFRS-R (ΔALSFRS-R) scores were calculated and patients were grouped into three categories, namely, patients with slow progression with ΔALSFRS-R scores ≤3 (n=19), intermediate progression with ΔALSFRS-R scores =4, 5 and 6 (n=36) and rapid progression with ΔALSFRS-R scores ≥7 (n=12). We analysed voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics among these subgroups and controls.
RESULTS: In comparison with controls, patients with ALS showed grey matter atrophy and decreased fractional anisotropy beyond the motor cortex and CST, especially in the frontotemporal lobes and basal ganglia. Moreover, the degree of change was highly proportional to ΔALSFRS-R at the 6-month assessment.
CONCLUSION: A more rapid disease progression and poorer functional decline were associated with greater involvement of the extra-motor cortex and basal ganglia, suggesting that the spatial extent of brain involvement can be an indicator of the progression in ALS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test blood and CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in relation to disease progression and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
METHODS: Using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, NfL levels were measured in samples from 2 cohorts of patients with sporadic ALS and healthy controls, recruited in London (ALS/control, plasma: n = 103/42) and Oxford (ALS/control, serum: n = 64/36; paired CSF: n = 38/20). NfL levels in patients were measured at regular intervals for up to 3 years. Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised score was used to assess disease progression. Survival was evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: CSF, serum, and plasma NfL discriminated patients with ALS from healthy controls with high sensitivity (97\%, 89\%, 90\%, respectively) and specificity (95\%, 75\%, 71\%, respectively). CSF NfL was highly correlated with serum levels (r = 0.78, p {\textless} 0.0001). Blood NfL levels were approximately 4 times as high in patients with ALS compared with controls in both cohorts, and maintained a relatively constant expression during follow-up. Blood NfL levels at recruitment were strong, independent predictors of survival. The highest tertile of blood NfL at baseline had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.91 (95\% confidence interval 1.98-7.94, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Blood-derived NfL level is an easily accessible biomarker with prognostic value in ALS. The individually relatively stable levels longitudinally offer potential for NfL as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in future therapeutic trials.

To evaluate serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH), and to compare these to levels of neurofilament light (NfL), as biomarkers of pre-symptomatic ALS. Design. The study population includes 34 controls, 79 individuals at-risk for ALS, 22 ALS patients, and 14 phenoconverters. At-risk individuals are enrolled through Pre-Symptomatic Familial ALS (Pre-fALS), a longitudinal natural history and biomarker study of individuals who are carriers of any ALS-associated gene mutation, but who demonstrate no clinical evidence of disease at the time of enrollment. pNfH and NfL in serum and CSF were quantified using established enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results. There is a longitudinal increase in serum pNfH in advance of the emergence of clinically manifest ALS. A similar pattern is observed for NfL, but with the absolute levels also frequently exceeding a normative threshold. Although CSF data are more sparse, similar patterns are observed for both neurofilaments, with absolute levels exceeding a normative threshold prior to phenoconversion. In serum, these changes are observed in the 6-12 months prior to disease among SOD1 A4V mutation carriers, and as far back as 2 and 3.5 years, respectively, in individuals with a FUS c.521del6 mutation and a C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Conclusions. Serum and CSF pNfH increase prior to phenoconversion. In CSF, the temporal course of these changes is similar to NfL. In serum, however, pNfH is less sensitive to pre-symptomatic disease than NfL. The duration of pre-symptomatic disease, as defined by changes in neurofilaments, may vary depending on underlying genotype.},

	abstract = {The routine clinical integration of individualized objective markers of disease activity in those diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a key requirement for therapeutic development. A large, multicentre, clinic-based, longitudinal cohort was used to systematically appraise the leading candidate biofluid biomarkers in the stratification and potential therapeutic assessment of those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Incident patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 258), other neurological diseases (n = 80) and healthy control participants (n = 101), were recruited and followed at intervals of 3-6 months for up to 30 months. Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain and chitotriosidase 1 and blood neurofilament light chain, creatine kinase, ferritin, complement C3 and C4 and C-reactive protein were measured. Blood neurofilament light chain, creatine kinase, serum ferritin, C3 and cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain and chitotriosidase 1 were all significantly elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. First-visit plasma neurofilament light chain level was additionally strongly associated with survival (hazard ratio for one standard deviation increase in log10 plasma neurofilament light chain 2.99, 95\% confidence interval 1.65-5.41, P = 0.016) and rate of disability progression, independent of other prognostic factors. A small increase in level was noted within the first 12 months after reported symptom onset (slope 0.031 log10 units per month, 95\% confidence interval 0.012-0.049, P = 0.006). Modelling the inclusion of plasma neurofilament light chain as a therapeutic trial outcome measure demonstrated that a significant reduction in sample size and earlier detection of disease-slowing is possible, compared with using the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale. This study provides strong evidence that blood neurofilament light chain levels outperform conventional measures of disease activity at the group level. The application of blood neurofilament light chain has the potential to radically reduce the duration and cost of therapeutic trials. It might also offer a first step towards the goal of more personalized objective disease activity monitoring for those living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in healthcare has produced valuable contributions to the prognosis field. This article presents a systematic and critical review of primary studies that used ML applied to the ALS prognosis, searching for databases, relevant predictor biomarkers, the ML algorithms and techniques, and their outcomes. We focused on studies that analyzed biomarkers commonly present in the ALS disease clinical practice, such as demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. Hence, we investigate studies to provide an overview of solutions that can be applied to develop decision support systems and be used by a higher number of ALS clinical settings. The studies were retrieved from PubMed, Science Direct, IEEEXplore, and Web of Science databases. After completing the searching and screening process, 10 articles were selected to be analyzed and summarized. The studies evaluated and used different ML algorithms, techniques, datasets, sample sizes, biomarkers, and performance metrics. Based on the results, three distinct types of prediction were identified: Disease Progression, Survival Time, and Need for Support. The biomarkers identified as relevant in more than one study were the ALSFRS/ALSFRS-R, disease duration, Forced Vital Capacity, Body Mass Index, age at onset, and Creatinine. In general, the studies presented promissory results that can be applied in developing decision support systems. Besides, we discussed the open challenges, the limitations identified, and future research opportunities.},

	abstract = {Objective:

To determine the diagnostic performance and prognostic value of phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNfH) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF as possible biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the diagnostic phase.
Methods:

We measured CSF pNfH and NfL concentrations in 220 patients with ALS, 316 neurologic disease controls (DC), and 50 genuine disease mimics (DM) to determine and assess the accuracy of the diagnostic cutoff value for pNfH and NfL and to correlate with other clinical parameters.
Results:

pNfH was most specific for motor neuron disease (specificity 88.2\% [confidence interval (CI) 83.0\%–92.3\%]). pNfH had the best performance to differentially diagnose patients with ALS from DM with a sensitivity of 90.7\% (CI 84.9\%–94.8\%), a specificity of 88.0\% (CI 75.7\%–95.5\%) and a likelihood ratio of 7.6 (CI 3.6–16.0) at a cutoff of 768 pg/mL. CSF pNfH and NfL levels were significantly lower in slow disease progressors, however, with a poor prognostic performance with respect to the disease progression rate. CSF pNfH and NfL levels increased significantly as function of the number of regions with both upper and lower motor involvement.
Conclusions:

In particular, CSF pNfH concentrations show an added value as diagnostic biomarkers for ALS, whereas the prognostic value of pNfH and NfL warrants further investigation. Both pNfH and NfL correlated with the extent of motor neuron degeneration.
Classification of evidence:

This study provides Class II evidence that elevated concentrations of CSF pNfH and NfL can accurately identify patients with ALS.},

The present study used the novel D50 model, which distinguishes between disease accumulation and aggressiveness, to probe correlations with measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI scans of 145 ALS patients and 69 controls were analyzed using tract-based-spatial-statistics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean- (MD), radial (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) maps. Intergroup contrasts were calculated between patients and controls, and between ALS subgroups: based on (a) the individual disease covered (Phase I vs. II) or b) patients' disease aggressiveness (D50 value). Regression analyses were used to probe correlations with model-derived parameters. Case–control comparisons revealed widespread ALS-related white matter pathology with decreased FA and increased MD/RD. These affected pathways showed also correlations with the accumulated disease for increased MD/RD, driven by the subgroup of Phase I patients. No significant differences were noted between patients in Phase I and II for any of the contrasts. Patients with high disease aggressiveness (D50 {\textless} 30 months) displayed increased AD/MD in bifrontal and biparietal pathways, which was corroborated by significant voxel-wise regressions with D50. Application of the D50 model revealed associations between DTI measures and ALS pathology in Phase I, representing individual disease accumulation early in disease. Patients' overall disease aggressiveness correlated robustly with the extent of DTI changes. We recommend the D50 model for studies developing/validating neuroimaging or other biomarkers for ALS.},

This task focuses on the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The goal of this work is to use patient demographic data \& certain medical history details along with collections of records of responses to an ALS diagnostic questionnaire to calculate risk scores corresponding to the likelihood that a patient will suffer an adverse event, and to predict the time window in which that event will occur. We present an approach based on ensemble learning, in which gradient-boosted regression trees are used to separately predict risk scores and estimate survival times. By normalising \& thresholding the risk scores, we generate event predictions which are combined with the time-to-event predictions to produce time-interval predictions. While some aspects of the results seem encouraging, especially given the amount of training data available, it is clear that more sophisticated and specialised solutions are required in order for techniques like these to become a reliable part of clinical decision-making.},

This heterogeneity has hindered efforts to assess the efficacy of developmental treatments designed to delay disease progression and prolong survival. As such, prediction of disease progression has been a long-standing interest in the field as a means of enabling better drug development using cheaper, more accurate clinical trials, as well as deriving new and important insights into disease mechanisms and manifestations. So far, this critical point has not yet been sufficiently addressed due to limited access to patient-level data and sophisticated computational tools. This contribution aims at comparing the performance of different baseline machine learning approaches on a common dataset obtained via the integration of different datasets from different countries provided by the challenge organisers. Results show that the ability of different methods across different subtasks to discriminate among subjects at risk and to predict the time of adverse events improves as dynamic variables, monitoring the first six months of patient follow-up, are included as possible predictors. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

Despite the lack of treatments, interventions such as non-invasive mechanical ventilation and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy can be made to prolong life expectancy when needed. Hence it would be clinically relevant to predict the patients’ need of such interventions. To this aim, the Intelligent Disease Progression Prediction challenge was organized, in which partecipants were tasked with developing new methods for risk and time-to-event prediction based on demographical and clinical features. Specifically, the challenge tasks consisted of predicting multiple competing risks, all related to ALS disease progression. We employ several machine learning methods generally applied to survival analysis and classification tasks, some of which are specialized for handling competing risks. All models were optimized through a cross-validation procedure and finally evaluated on an internal test set. The three best performing methods, namely Deep Survival Machines, Gradient boosted regression trees and Time-Aware Classifier Ensemble were selected and submitted to the IDPP challenge at CLEF 2022. The results of the competition showed that our methods achieve on average a c-index of ∼ 0.70 and ∼ 0.74, using data at time zero and up to six months, respectively. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives Deep neural networks recently become a popular tool in medical research to predict disease progression and unveil its underlying temporal phenotypes. While being well suited to study longitudinal clinical data and learn disease progression models, its application in clinical setting is challenged by the importance of model explainability. In this work, we integrate model learning using recurrent neural networks with deep model explanation using SHAP to study disease progression in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Methods We propose and evaluate different deep neural networks to predict disease progression in a large cohort of Portuguese ALS patients. We learn models of disease progression targeting the prediction and explanation of respiratory decline to respiratory failure, as measured by clinical administration of non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Afterward, we explain the learnt models using SHAP and inspect the outcome with clinical researchers, targeting the identification of highly influencing features in model prediction, and putative features to be discarded in an augmented model, due to their small influence. Results When used to predict breathing capability of ALS patients in different time windows, our recurrent neural networks with LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) showed mean squared errors below 0.01 and 0.02 in train and test, respectively. This enables their effective use to predict the need for non-invasive ventilation, and potentially other clinically relevant endpoints, while providing clinical insights regarding disease progression to respiratory insufficiency. It was exciting to find that this study supports previous results showing that neck weakness is related to disease outcome and respiratory decline in ALS. Conclusions Our study to learn and explain a predictive model for ALS shows the potentialities of using deep learning from longitudinal clinical data together with deep model explanation to achieve accurate prognostic prediction and model interpretability, while drawing insights into disease progression and promoting personalized medicine.},

Results A total of 46 studies were included. Structural MRI revealed hippocampal atrophy, especially in ALS-FTD, involving specific subregions (CA1, dentate gyrus). Disease progression and genetic factors impacted atrophy patterns. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed increased mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the hippocampal tracts and adjacent regions, indicating loss of neuronal and white matter integrity. Functional MRI (fMRI) revealed reduced functional connectivity (FC) between the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and other regions, suggesting disrupted networks. Perfusion MRI showed hypoperfusion in parahippocampal gyri. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) found changes in the hippocampus, indicating neuronal loss. Neuropsychological tests showed associations between poorer memory and hippocampal atrophy or connectivity changes. CA1-2, dentate gyrus, and fimbria atrophy were correlated with worse memory. Conclusions The hippocampus and the connected regions are involved in ALS. Hippocampal atrophy disrupted connectivity and metabolite changes correlate with cognitive and functional decline. Specific subregions can be particularly affected. The hippocampus is a potential biomarker for disease monitoring and prognosis.},

We aim to investigate brain functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in a cohort of ALS patients, examined at diagnosis and clinically monitored over 18 months, in order to early discriminate fast progressors (FPs) from slow progressors (SPs). Methods: Resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses were performed at baseline in 54 patients with ALS and 22 HCs. ALS patients were classified a posteriori into FPs (n = 25) and SPs (n = 29) based on changes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised score from baseline to the 18-month assessment (ΔALSFRS-R), applying a k-means clustering algorithm. Results: At diagnosis, when compared to HCs, ALS patients showed reduced functional connectivity in both motor and extra-motor networks. When compared to SPs, at baseline, FPs showed decreased function connectivity in paracentral lobule (sensorimotor network), precuneus (in the default mode network), middle frontal gyri (frontoparietal networks) and increased functional connectivity in insular cortices (salience network). Structural analyses did not reveal significant differences in gray and white matter damage by comparing FPs to SPs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that functional connectivity increase in the left insula at baseline best discriminated FPs and SPs (area under the curve 78\%). Conclusions: Impairment of extra-motor networks may appear early in ALS patients with faster disease progression, suggesting that a more widespread functional connectivity damage may be an indicator of poorer prognosis.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results in progressive impairment of upper and lower motor neurons. Increasing evidence from both in vivo and ex vivo studies suggest that iron accumulation in the motor cortex is a neuropathological hallmark in ALS. An in vivo neuroimaging marker of iron dysregulation in ALS would be useful in disease diagnosis and prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its unique capability to generate a variety of soft tissue contrasts, provides opportunities to image iron distribution in the human brain with millimeter to sub-millimeter anatomical resolution. Conventionally, MRI T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted images have been used to investigate iron dysregulation in the brain in vivo. Susceptibility weighted imaging has enhanced contrast for para-magnetic materials that provides superior sensitivity to iron in vivo. Recently, the development of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) has realized the possibility of using quantitative assessments of magnetic susceptibility measures in brain tissues as a surrogate measurement of in vivo brain iron. In this review, we provide an overview of MRI techniques that have been used to investigate iron dysregulation in ALS in vivo. The potential uses, strengths, and limitations of these techniques in clinical trials, disease diagnosis, and prognosis are presented and discussed. We recommend further longitudinal studies with appropriate cohort characterization to validate the efficacy of these techniques. We conclude that quantitative iron assessment using recent advances in MRI including QSM holds great potential to be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker in ALS. The use of multimodal neuroimaging markers in combination with iron imaging may also offer improved sensitivity in ALS diagnosis and prognosis that could make a major contribution to clinical care and treatment trials.

	abstract = {Objective
To evaluate cerebral degenerative changes in ALS and their correlates with survival using 3D texture analysis.

Methods
A total of 157 participants were included in this analysis from four neuroimaging studies. Voxel‐wise texture analysis on T1‐weighted brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) was conducted between patients and controls. Patients were divided into long‐ and short‐survivors using the median survival of the cohort. Neuroanatomical differences between the two survival groups were also investigated.

Results
Whole‐brain analysis revealed significant changes in image texture (FDR 
P {\textless} 0.05) bilaterally in the motor cortex, corticospinal tract (CST), insula, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and frontal regions including subcortical white matter. The texture of the CST correlated (P {\textless} 0.05) with finger‐ and foot‐tapping rate, measures of upper motor neuron function. Patients with a survival below the media of 19.5 months demonstrated texture change (FDR 
P {\textless} 0.05) in the motor cortex, CST, basal ganglia, and the hippocampus, a distribution which corresponds to stage 4 of the distribution TDP‐43 pathology in ALS. Patients with longer survival exhibited texture changes restricted to motor regions, including the motor cortex and the CST.

Interpretation
Widespread gray and white matter pathology is evident in ALS, as revealed by texture analysis of conventional T1‐weighted MRI. Length of survival in patients with ALS is associated with the spatial extent of cerebral degeneration.},

	abstract = {Objective The purpose of this study was to identify subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by comparing patterns of neurodegeneration using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and explore their phenotypes. Methods We performed T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging in 488 clinically well-characterized patients with ALS and 338 control subjects. Measurements of whole-brain cortical thickness and white matter connectome fractional anisotropy were adjusted for disease-unrelated variation. A probabilistic network-based clustering algorithm was used to divide patients into subgroups of similar neurodegeneration patterns. Clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles were assessed for each subgroup. In total, 512 follow-up scans were used to validate clustering results longitudinally. Results The clustering algorithm divided patients with ALS into 3 subgroups of 187, 163, and 138 patients. All subgroups displayed involvement of the precentral gyrus and are characterized, respectively, by (1) pure motor involvement (pure motor cluster [PM]), (2) orbitofrontal and temporal involvement (frontotemporal cluster [FT]), and (3) involvement of the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal white matter, temporal operculum, and cerebellum (cingulate-parietal–temporal cluster [CPT]). These subgroups had significantly distinct clinical profiles regarding male-to-female ratio, age at symptom onset, and frequency of bulbar symptom onset. FT and CPT revealed higher rates of cognitive impairment on the Edinburgh cognitive and behavioral ALS screen (ECAS). Longitudinally, clustering remained stable: at 90.4\% of their follow-up visits, patients clustered in the same subgroup as their baseline visit. Interpretation ALS can manifest itself in 3 main patterns of cerebral neurodegeneration, each associated with distinct clinical characteristics and cognitive profiles. Besides the pure motor and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-like variants of ALS, a new neuroimaging phenotype has emerged, characterized by posterior cingulate, parietal, temporal, and cerebellar involvement.

Although neuroimaging studies have shown multiple structural changes in ALS patients, few studies have investigated structural alterations in the brainstem. Herein, we compared the brainstem structure between patients with ALS and healthy controls.MethodsA total of 33 patients with ALS and 33 healthy controls were recruited in this study. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were acquired on a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (3T MRI) scanner. Volumetric and vertex-wised approaches were implemented to assess the differences in the brainstem’s morphological features between the two groups. An atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis was performed to compare the white matter integrity of the brainstem between the two groups. Additionally, a correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between ALS clinical characteristics and structural features.ResultsVolumetric analyses showed no significant difference in the subregion volume of the brainstem between ALS patients and healthy controls. In the shape analyses, ALS patients had a local abnormal surface contraction in the ventral medulla oblongata and ventral pons. Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left corticospinal tract (CST) and bilateral frontopontine tracts (FPT) at the brainstem level, and higher radial diffusivity (RD) in bilateral CST and left FPT at the brainstem level by ROI analysis in DTI. Correlation analysis showed that disease severity was positively associated with FA in left CST and left FPT.ConclusionThese findings suggest that the brainstem in ALS suffers atrophy, and degenerative processes in the brainstem may reflect disease severity in ALS. These findings may be helpful for further understanding of potential neural mechanisms in ALS.},

	abstract = {Background
Unconventional magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brainstem have recently acquired a growing interest in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology since they provide a unique opportunity to evaluate motor tract degeneration and bulbar lower motor neuron involvement. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of brainstem structures as accurate biomarkers of disease severity and predictors of survival.
Materials and Methods
A total of 60 ALS patients and 30 healthy controls subjects (CS) were recruited in this study. Patients were divided in two subgroups according to the onset of the disease: 42 spinal (S-ALS) and 18 bulbar (B-ALS). All subjects underwent 3D-structural MRI. Brainstem volume both of the entire cohort of ALS patients and S-ALS and B-ALS onset were compared with those of CS. In addition the two ALS subgroups were tested for differences in brainstem volumes. Volumetric, vertex-wise, and voxel-based approaches were implemented to assess correlations between MR structural features and clinical characteristics expressed as ALSFRS-r and its bulbar (ALSFSR-r-B) and spinal subscores (ALSFSR-r-S). ROC curves were performed to test the accuracy of midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata volumes able to discriminate patients dichotomized into long and short survivors by using Two-Steps cluster analysis. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were carried out to test the prognostic role of brainstem structures’ volume, trichotomized by applying a k-means clustering algorithm.
Results
Both the entire cohort of ALS patients and B-ALS and S-ALS showed significant lower volumes of both medulla oblongata and pons compared to CS. Furthermore, B-ALS showed a significant lower volume of medulla oblongata, compared to S-ALS. Lower score of ALSFRS-r correlated to atrophy in the anterior compartment of midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata, as well as in the posterior portion of only this latter region. ALSFSR-r-S positively correlated with shape deformation and density reduction of the anterior portion of the entire brainstem, along the corticospinal tracts. ALSFSR-r-B instead showed a positive correlation with shape deformation of the floor of the fourth ventricle in the medulla oblongata and the crus cerebri in the midbrain. Only medulla oblongata volume demonstrated a significant accuracy to discriminate long and short survivors ALS patients (ROC AUC 0.76, p {\textless} 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed the survival predictive role of the medulla oblongata (log rank test p: 0.003).
Discussions
Our findings suggest that brainstem volume may reflect the impairment of corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts as well as lower bulbar motor neurons. Furthermore, medulla oblongata could be used as an early predictor of survival in ALS patients.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective
Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can be used to tract-wise map correlates of the sequential disease progression and, therefore, to assess disease stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in vivo. According to a threshold-based sequential scheme, a classification of ALS patients into disease stages is possible, however, several patients cannot be staged for methodological reasons. This study aims to implement a multivariate Bayesian classification algorithm for disease stage prediction at an individual ALS patient level based on DTI metrics of involved tract systems to improve disease stage mapping.
Methods
The analysis of fiber tracts involved in each stage of ALS was performed in 325 ALS patients and 130 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Based on Bayes’ theorem and in accordance with the sequential disease progression, a multistage classifier was implemented. Patients were categorized into in vivo DTI stages using the threshold-based method and the Bayesian algorithm. By the margin of confidence, the reliability of the Bayesian categorizations was accessible.
Results
Based on the Bayesian multistage classifier, 88\% of all ALS patients could be assigned into an ALS stage compared to 77\% using the threshold-based staging scheme. Additionally, the confidence of all classifications could be estimated.
Conclusions
By the application of the multi-stage Bayesian classifier, an individualized in vivo cerebral staging of ALS patients was possible based on the sequentially involved tract systems and, furthermore, the reliability of the respective classifications could be determined. The Bayesian classification algorithm is an improvement of the threshold-based staging method and could provide a framework for extending the DTI-based in vivo cerebral staging in ALS.},

ALS patients versus controls showed a significantly increased functional connectivity between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and cerebellum-crus II. No right SMC connectivity changes were found. The pattern of increased functional connectivity to the left SMC was more widespread when considering only patients with no CST DT MRI abnormalities than the whole group of patients. In this patient group, functional connectivity was also increased between the right SMC and the right parahippocampal gyrus. On the contrary, in ALS patients with CST damage (as assessed using DT MRI) versus controls, functional connectivity was increased between the left SMC and the right cingulate cortex only, while it was decreased between the right SMC and the right cerebellum-lobule VI. In ALS patients, disease severity correlated with reduced SMC functional connectivity. Functional brain changes do occur in ALS with mild disability. These changes might have a role in compensating for (limited) structural damage and might exhaust with increasing burden of disease pathology.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) multiple motor and extra-motor regions display structural and functional alterations. However, their temporal dynamics during disease-progression are unknown. To address this question we employed a longitudinal design assessing motor- and novelty-related brain activity in two fMRI sessions separated by a 3-month interval. In each session, patients and controls executed a Go/NoGo-task, in which additional presentation of novel stimuli served to elicit hippocampal activity. We observed a decline in the patients' movement-related activity during the 3-month interval. Importantly, in comparison to controls, the patients' motor activations were higher during the initial measurement. Thus, the relative decrease seems to reflect a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms due to progressive neural loss within the motor-system. In contrast, the patients' novelty-evoked hippocampal activity increased across 3 months, most likely reflecting the build-up of compensatory processes typically observed at the beginning of lesions. Consistent with a stage-dependent emergence of hippocampal and motor-system lesions, we observed a positive correlation between the ALSFRS-R or MRC-Megascores and the decline in motor activity, but a negative one with the hippocampal activation-increase. Finally, to determine whether the observed functional changes co-occur with structural alterations, we performed voxel-based volumetric analyses on magnetization transfer images in a separate patient cohort studied cross-sectionally at another scanning site. Therein, we observed a close overlap between the structural changes in this cohort, and the functional alterations in the other. Thus, our results provide important insights into the temporal dynamics of functional alterations during disease-progression, and provide support for an anatomical relationship between functional and structural cerebral changes in ALS.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the relationship of cerebral degeneration with survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Methods
Patients with probable or definite ALS underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of the brain between July 1996 and May 2002, and were followed prospectively until March 2004. Creatine (Cr), choline (Cho) and the neuronal marker N‐acetylaspartate (NAA) were quantified as ratios in the motor cortex.

Results
In 63 patients compared with 18 healthy people, NAA/Cho was reduced by 13\% (p{\textless}0.001), NAA/Cr was reduced by 5\% (p = 0.01) and Cho/Cr was increased by 8\% (p = 0.01). NAA/Cho was used for survival analysis, given its larger effect size and superior test accuracy (a sensitivity of 67\% and a specificity of 83\%). Median survival after MRSI was 24 months. Multivariate analysis showed reduced survival for lower NAA/Cho (hazard ratio (HR) 0.24, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 0.72, p = 0.01), older age (HR 1.03, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.06, p = 0.04) and shorter symptom duration (HR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.93 to 0.99, p = 0.01). Patients with NAA/Cho {\textless}2.11 had a reduced survival of 19.4 v 31.9 months (HR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.12 to 4.03, p = 0.02).

Conclusions
Cerebral degeneration is predictive of reduced survival in ALS.},

Brain conventional and DT MRI were obtained from 18 healthy subjects and 24 patients with sporadic ALS. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of the CST were obtained. Patients were scanned at baseline, then entered a longitudinal clinical follow-up. The ALS Functional Rating scale (ALSFRS) progression rate during follow-up was estimated. Patients were followed up prospectively for a median period of 3.4 years. Two patients were lost at follow-up and eight died during the observation period. The mean ALSFRS progression rate was 0.7/month (range = 0.0–2.0/month). At baseline, ALS patients showed significantly increased MD and decreased FA of the CST compared with controls. CST FA was associated with ALSFRS progression rate. ALSFRS deterioration rate and CST FA were independent predictors of survival in ALS patients. Survival at year 3 was 42\% in patients with CST FA ≤ 0.56 compared with 90\% in patients with CST FA {\textgreater} 0.56. This study shows that more severe CST DT MRI abnormalities predict a poorer long-term clinical outcome in ALS patients.

Results: The texture feature autocorrelation was significantly higher in ALS patients compared to healthy controls in the precentral gyrus and basal ganglia (p {\textless} 0.05). Autocorrelation correlated significantly with clinical measures such as disease progression rate and finger tapping speed (p {\textless} 0.05).

The frontotemporal cortex and basal ganglia were considered areas of interest, based on pathological studies. Eight patients showed rapid clinical progression of ALS during the follow-up period. Compared to controls, all ALS patients showed progression of GM atrophy in left premotor cortex and right basal ganglia. Patients with rapidly progressing ALS showed GM atrophy changes in a larger motor cortical-subcortical area and in extramotor frontal regions compared to both controls and to non-rapidly progressing cases. Thus, TBM detected longitudinal atrophy changes in the motor network in ALS occurring over less than one year. The faster the clinical progression, the greater was the GM loss in motor and prefrontal areas. Further advances in tracking longitudinal changes in cortical and subcortical regions in ALS may provide an objective marker for monitoring disease progression, and the disease-modifying effect of potential treatments.},

	abstract = {Objective
To characterize disease evolution in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using an event‐based model designed to extract temporal information from cross‐sectional data. Conventional methods for understanding mechanisms of rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders are limited by the subjectivity inherent in the selection of a limited range of measurements, and the need to acquire longitudinal data.

Methods
The event‐based model characterizes a disease as a series of events, each comprising a significant change in subject state. The model was applied to data from 154 patients and 128 healthy controls selected from five independent diffusion MRI datasets acquired in four different imaging laboratories between 1999 and 2016. The biomarkers modeled were mean fractional anisotropy values of white matter tracts implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The cerebral portion of the corticospinal tract was divided into three segments.

Results
Application of the model to the pooled datasets revealed that the corticospinal tracts were involved before other white matter tracts. Distal corticospinal tract segments were involved earlier than more proximal (i.e., cephalad) segments. In addition, the model revealed early ordering of fractional anisotropy change in the corpus callosum and subsequently in long association fibers.

Interpretation
These findings represent data‐driven evidence for early involvement of the corticospinal tracts and body of the corpus callosum in keeping with conventional approaches to image analysis, while providing new evidence to inform directional degeneration of the corticospinal tracts. This data‐driven model provides new insight into the dynamics of neuronal damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.},

In this study, precentral and postcentral cortical thinning detected by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were combined with clinical (ALS-specific functional rating scale revised, ALSFRS-R) and neurophysiological (motor unit number index, MUNIX) biomarkers in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses.Methods: The unicenter sample included 20 limb-onset classical ALS patients compared to 30 age-related healthy controls. ALS patients were treated with standard Riluzole and additional long-term G-CSF (Filgrastim) on a named patient basis after written informed consent. Combinatory biomarker use included cortical thickness of atlas-based dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the precentral and postcentral cortex, ALSFRS-R, and MUNIX for the musculus abductor digiti minimi (ADM) bilaterally. Individual cross-sectional analysis investigated individual cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to age-related healthy controls in the context of state of disease at initial MRI scan. Beyond correlation analysis of biomarkers at cross-sectional group level (n = 20), longitudinal monitoring in a subset of slow progressive ALS patients (n = 4) explored within-subject temporal dynamics of repeatedly assessed biomarkers in time courses over at least 18 months.Results: Cross-sectional analysis demonstrated individually variable states of cortical thinning, which was most pronounced in the ventral section of the precentral cortex. Correlations of ALSFRS-R with cortical thickness and MUNIX were detected. Individual longitudinal biomarker monitoring in four slow progressive ALS patients revealed evident differences in individual disease courses and temporal dynamics of the biomarkers.Conclusion: A combinatory use of structural MRI, neurophysiological and clinical biomarkers allows for an appropriate and detailed assessment of clinical state and course of disease of ALS.},

We aimed to analyse and compare proposed candidate markers for disease progression in the course of ALS. Blood samples were taken from 125 ALS patients, including nine patients with C9orf72 or SOD1 mutation, at regular intervals of six months. ALS patients were characterized by the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R) and the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen (ECAS). We quantified neurofilament light chain (NF-L), S100B, and progranulin (PGRN) and analysed it in relation to disease progression. Results showed that, at baseline, serum concentrations of NF-L but not PGRN or S100B discriminated significantly between ALS and controls. Within 24 months follow-up the marker concentrations remained stable. Baseline serum NF-L levels correlated with survival time, which was confirmed in subgroups with fast, intermediate, and slow disease progression and there was a weak association with disease duration. For S100B and PGRN we found an association with ALSFRS-R score changes and a trend for decreased levels in the fast progressor subgroup. In conclusion, serum NF-L in any ALS disease stage is a promising marker to support diagnosis and predict outcome, while serum PGRN and S100B are only of minor prognostic value.},

	abstract = {Background Motor Unit Number Index (MUNIX) is a novel neurophysiological measure that provides an index of the number of functional lower motor neurons in a given muscle. So far its performance across centres in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has not been investigated.
Objective To perform longitudinal MUNIX recordings in a set of muscles in a multicentre setting in order to evaluate its value as a marker of disease progression.
Methods Three centres applied MUNIX in 51 ALS patients over 15 months. Six different muscles (abductor pollicis brevis, abductor digiti minimi, biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, extensor dig. brevis, abductor hallucis) were measured every 3 months on the less affected side. The decline between MUNIX and ALSFRS-R was compared.
Results 31 participants reached month 12. For all participants, ALSFRS-R declined at a rate of 2.3\%/month. Using the total score of all muscles, MUNIX declined significantly faster by 3.2\%/month (p≤0.02). MUNIX in individual muscles declined between 2.4\% and 4.2\%, which differed from ASLFRS-R decline starting from month 3 (p≤0.05 to 0.002). Subgroups with bulbar, lower and upper limb onset showed different decline rates of ALSFRS-R between 1.9\% and 2.8\%/month, while MUNIX total scores showed similar decline rates over all subgroups. Mean intraclass correlation coefficient for MUNIX intra-rater reliability was 0.89 and for inter-rater reliability 0.80.
Conclusion MUNIX is a reliable electrophysiological biomarker to track lower motor neuron loss in ALS.},

Forty-three patients with ALS (25 males) and 43 age- and gender-matched healthy controls underwent MRI on a 3T scanner. We used T1-weighted 3D images covering the whole brain and the cervical SC to estimate cervical SC area and eccentricity at C2/C3 level using validated software (SpineSeg). Disease severity was quantified with the ALSFRS-R and ALS Severity scores. SC areas of patients and controls were compared with a Mann-Whitney test. We used linear regression to investigate association between SC area and clinical parameters. Results showed that mean age of patients and disease duration were 53.1 ± 12.2 years and 34.0 ± 29.8 months, respectively. The two groups were significantly different regarding SC areas (67.8 ± 6.8 mm² vs. 59.5 ± 8.4 mm², p {\textless} 0.001). Eccentricity values were similar in both groups (p = 0.394). SC areas correlated with disease duration (r = − 0.585, p {\textless} 0.001), ALSFRS-R score (r = 0.309, p = 0.044) and ALS Severity scale (r = 0.347, p = 0.022). In conclusion, patients with ALS have SC atrophy, but no flattening. In addition, SC areas correlated with disease duration and functional status. These data suggest that quantitative MRI of the SC may be a useful biomarker in the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The extensive application of advanced MR imaging techniques has undoubtedly improved our knowledge of the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Nevertheless, the precise extent of neurodegeneration throughout the central nervous system is not fully understood. In the present study, we assessed the spatial distribution of cortical damage in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by using a cortical thickness measurement approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surface-based morphometry was performed on 20 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants. Clinical scores of disability and disease progression were correlated with measures of cortical thickness.
RESULTS: The patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis showed a significant cortical thinning in multiple motor and extramotor cortical areas when compared with healthy control participants. Gray matter loss was significantly related to disease disability in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (P = .04), to disease duration in the right premotor cortex (P = .007), and to disease progression rate in the left parahippocampal cortex (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical thinning of the motor cortex might reflect upper motor neuron impairment, whereas the extramotor involvement seems to be related to disease disability, progression, and duration. The cortical pattern of neurodegeneration depicted resembles what has already been described in frontotemporal dementia, thereby providing further structural evidence of a continuum between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia.},

	abstract = {Objectives Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterised by combined upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. An early and accurate diagnosis is important for patient care and might facilitate the search for a more effective therapy. MRI was used to study the whole cortical mantle, applying an unbiased surface based approach to identify a marker of upper motor neuron involvement in ALS.
Methods Surface based cortical morphology analyses were performed on structural, 3T MRI data of 45 patients with ALS and 25 matched healthy controls in a case control study design. These analyses consisted of measuring cortical thickness, surface area and volume. The effects of disease progression were examined by correlating cortical measures with progression rate and by longitudinal measures in 20 patients.
Results Cortical morphology analyses revealed specific thinning in the precentral gyrus, considered the primary motor cortex, in patients with ALS compared with controls (p=6.3×10−8). Surface area was reduced in the right inferior parietal region (p=0.049) and volume—the product of cortical thickness and surface area—was reduced in the right precentral gyrus (p=0.031). From these findings, it appears that cortical thickness is superior in detecting the degenerative effects of ALS. Relative cortical thinning in temporal regions was related to faster clinical progression (right inferior temporal gyrus: p=3.3×10−4).
Conclusions Cortical thinning of the primary motor cortex might be a diagnostic marker for upper motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Relative thinning in temporal regions was associated with a rapidly progressive disease course.},

	abstract = {Background
The survival time of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is greatly variable and protective or risk effects of the potential survival predictors are controversial. Thus, we aim to undertake a comprehensive meta-analysis of studies investigating non-genetic prognostic and survival factors in patients with ALS.
Methods
A search of relevant literature from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and other citations from 1st January 1966 to 1st December 020 was conducted. Random-effects models were conducted to pool the multivariable or adjusted hazard ratios (HR) by Stata MP 16.0. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021256923.
Findings
A total of 5717 reports were identified, with 115 studies meeting pre-designed inclusion criteria involving 55,169 ALS patients. Five dimensions, including demographic, environmental or lifestyle, clinical manifestations, biochemical index, therapeutic factors or comorbidities were investigated. Twenty-five prediction factors, including twenty non-intervenable and five intervenable factors, were associated with ALS survival. Among them, NFL (HR:3.70, 6.80, in serum and CSF, respectively), FTD (HR:2.98), ALSFRS-R change (HR:2.37), respiratory subtype (HR:2.20), executive dysfunction (HR:2.10) and age of onset (HR:1.03) were superior predictors for poor prognosis, but pLMN or pUMN (HR:0.32), baseline ALSFRS-R score (HR:0.95), duration (HR:0.96), diagnostic delay (HR:0.97) were superior predictors for a good prognosis. Our results did not support the involvement of gender, education level, diabetes, hypertension, NIV, gastrostomy, and statins in ALS survival.
Interpretation
Our study provided a comprehensive and quantitative index for assessing the prognosis for ALS patients, and the identified non-intervenable or intervenable factors will facilitate the development of treatment strategies for ALS.

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease among adults. With diagnosis reached relatively late into the disease process, extensive motor cell loss narrows the window for therapeutic opportunities. Clinical heterogeneity in ALS and the lack of disease-specific biomarkers have so far led to large-sized clinical trials with long follow-up needed to define clinical outcomes. In advanced ALS patients, there is presently limited scope to use imaging or invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection as a source of disease biomarkers. The development of more patient-friendly and accessible blood biomarker assays is hampered by analytical hurdles like the matrix effect of blood components. However, blood also provides the opportunity to identify disease-specific adaptive changes of the stoichiometry and conformation of target proteins and the endogenous immunological response to low-abundance brain peptides, such as neurofilaments (Nf). Among those biomarkers under investigation in ALS, the change in concentration before or after diagnosis of Nf has been shown to aid prognostication and to allow the a priori stratification of ALS patients into smaller sized and clinically more homogeneous cohorts, supporting more affordable clinical trials. Here, we discuss the technical hurdles affecting reproducible and sensitive biomarker measurement in blood. We also summarize the state of the art of non-CSF biomarkers in the study of prognosis, disease progression, and treatment response. We will then address the potential as disease-specific biomarkers of the newly discovered cryptic peptides which are formed down-stream of TDP-43 loss of function, the hallmark of ALS pathobiology.},

If physical use of a limb were important in defining the site of onset, then handedness might be expected to influence the side of upper limb-onset disease and footedness likewise in lower limb-onset ALS.
Methods ALS patients registered with an internet-based support site were invited to complete an online questionnaire concerning site of onset of symptoms and their dominant hand and foot. A binomial test of proportions was used to investigate the null hypothesis that handedness and footedness do not influence side of onset in upper and lower limb-onset ALS, respectively.
Results 343 ALS patients with limb-onset disease were studied. For upper limb-onset patients, there was concordance for side of onset and handedness (64\%; p{\textless}0.0006). For lower limb-onset patients, concordance for side of onset and footedness was absent. The frequency of left handedness was commensurate with that found in the general population.
Interpretation These results are potentially consistent with the hypothesis that exercise influences pathogenesis in ALS since routine physical demands on the upper limb are heavily influenced by limb dominance, whereas in the lower limbs the commonest function is standing or locomotion, which uses both legs equally. However, there may also be an inherent cortical vulnerability underlying upper limb-onset laterality, possibly influenced by changes in neuronal connectivity and cortical excitability in relation to handedness and reflected by the “split hand” phenomenon consistently observed in ALS.},

              With anatomical magnetic resonance imaging, the signal intensity of the corticospinal tract (CST) at the level of the internal capsule is often paradoxically similar to that of grey matter. As shown previously in histological studies, this is likely due to the presence of very large axons. We measured the apparent grey‐matter density (aGMd) of the putative CST (pCST) in a large cohort of adolescents (
              n
              = 409, aged 12–18 years). We tested the following hypotheses: (1) The aGMd in the pCST shows a hemispheric asymmetry that is, in turn, related to hand preference; (2) the maturation of the CST during adolescence differs between both sexes, due to the influence of testosterone; (3) variations in aGMd in the pCST reflect inter‐individual differences in manual skills. We confirmed the first two predictions. Thus, we found a strong left {\textgreater} right hemispheric asymmetry in aGMd that was, on average, less marked in the 40 left‐handed subjects. Apparent GMd in the pCST increased with age in adolescent males but not females, and this was particularly related to rising plasma levels of testosterone in male adolescents. This finding is compatible with the idea that testosterone influences axonal calibre rather than myelination. The third prediction, namely that of a relationship between age‐related changes in manual skills and maturation of the pCST, was not confirmed. We conclude that the leftward asymmetry of the pCST may reflect an early established asymmetry in the number of large corticomotoneuronal fibres in the pCST.

	abstract = {For patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the primary therapeutic goal is to minimize morbidity. Non-invasive ventilation improves survival. We aim to assess whether Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the cervical spinal cord predicts the progression of respiratory disorders in ALS. Brain and spinal MRI was repeatedly performed in the SOD1G86R mouse model, in 40 patients and in healthy controls. Atrophy, iron overload, white matter diffusivity and neuronal loss were assessed. In Superoxide Dismutase-1 (SOD1) mice, iron accumulation appeared in the cervical spinal cord at symptom onset but disappeared with disease progression (after the onset of atrophy). In ALS patients, the volumes of the motor cortex and the medulla oblongata were already abnormally low at the time of diagnosis. Baseline diffusivity in the internal capsule was predictive of functional handicap. The decrease in cervical spinal cord volume from diagnosis to 3 months was predictive of the change in slow vital capacity at 12 months. MRI revealed marked abnormalities at the time of ALS diagnosis. Early atrophy of the cervical spinal cord may predict the progression of respiratory disorders, and so may be of value in patient care and as a primary endpoint in pilot neuroprotection studies.},

	abstract = {Background
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that leads to death within a few years after diagnosis. Malnutrition and weight loss are frequent and are indexes of poor prognosis. Total body fat and fat distribution have not been studied in ALS patients.

Objectives
Our aim was to describe adipose tissue content and distribution in ALS patients.

Design
We performed a cross-sectional study in a group of ALS patients (n = 62, mean disease duration 22 months) along with age and gender matched healthy controls (n = 62) using a MRI-based method to study quantitatively the fat distribution.

Results
Total body fat of ALS patients was not changed as compared with controls. However, ALS patients displayed increased visceral fat and an increased ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat. Visceral fat was not correlated with clinical severity as judged using the ALS functional rating scale (ALS-FRS-R), while subcutaneous fat in ALS patients correlated positively with ALS-FRS-R and disease progression. Multiple regression analysis showed that gender and ALS-FRS-R, but not site of onset, were significant predictors of total and subcutaneous fat. Increased subcutaneous fat predicted survival in male patients but not in female patients (p{\textless}0.05).

Conclusions
Fat distribution is altered in ALS patients, with increased visceral fat as compared with healthy controls. Subcutaneous fat content is a predictor of survival of ALS patients.},

Many studies using both qualitative and quantitative evaluations have reported abnormal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings at the level of the pyramidal pathway in patients with ALS. Although the most interesting results were obtained by quantitative studies using advanced MR techniques, the qualitative evaluation of MRI images remains the most-used in clinical practice. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic contribution of conventional 3T-MRI in the clinical work-up of ALS patients. Two neuroradiologists retrospectively assessed 3T-MRI data of 93 ALS patients and 89 controls. The features of interest were corticospinal tract (CST) T2/FLAIR hyperintensity, motor cortex (MC) T2*/SWI hypointensity, and selective MC atrophy. All MRI features were significantly more prevalent in ALS patients than in controls. The simultaneous presence of CST FLAIR hyperintensity and MC SWI hypointensity was associated with the highest diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity: 70\%; specificity: 81\%; positive predictive value, PPV: 90\%; negative predictive value, NPV: 51\%; accuracy: 73\%) and a shorter survival (HR: 6.56, p = 0.002). Conventional 3T-MRI can be a feasible tool to detect specific qualitative changes based on UMN involvement and to support clinical diagnosis of ALS. Importantly, CST FLAIR hyperintensity and MC SWI hypointensity are predictors of shorter survival in ALS patients.},

	abstract = {Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease that targets motor neurons. Upper motor neurons degeneration is pathologically characterized by brain iron accumulation. Signal attenuation in the shape of a ribbon at the posterior border of the precentral gyrus can be observed on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences including T2-weighted sequence. Methods: With the aim to know the qualities of this potential marker of ALS, we conducted a prospective study. Patients with definite ALS in the age range of 40–70 years and healthy controls underwent 3T brain MRI using a standardized sequence. A second MRI was performed 18 months later under the same conditions in the patients with ALS. Results: Most of the patients with ALS (91.66\%) exhibited a “black ribbon” (BR) with an average area of 79.98 mm3. Signal attenuation discriminated ALS with a mean value of 63.97 arbitrary units (AU) on the left BR (95\% CI: 60.67–67.27), a mean value of 59.15 AU (95\% CI: 54.78–63.53) on the right BR, and a significant difference with control subjects presenting a mean value of 107.85 AU (p {\textless} 0.001). The optimal cut-off point for differentiating patients with ALS from controls (sensitivity, 0.92; specificity, 0.93) was 83 AU. Forced vital capacity and muscle strength in the contralateral upper extremity were significantly correlated with the ribbon intensity in ALS. Patients who underwent a second study exhibited significant changes in the BR related to the rapid evolution of the disease. Conclusions: This marker represents a valuable tool for the selection of candidates and their follow-up in clinical trials., L’hypo-intensité du cortex moteur est-elle une des caractéristiques de la sclérose latérale amyotrophique? Contexte: La sclérose latérale amyotrophique (SLA) est une maladie dévastatrice qui affecte les neurones moteurs. Sur le plan pathologique, la dégénérescence de ces neurones est caractérisée par une accumulation de fer dans le cerveau. L’affaiblissement du potentiel nerveux lié à cette maladie prend la forme d’un ruban situé à la limite postérieure du gyrus précentral. Un tel symptôme peut être observé au moyen de séquences tirées d’examens d’IRM conventionnelle, ce qui inclut la pondération T2. Méthodes: Nous avons mené une étude prospective avec l’objectif de mieux connaître les propriétés de ce marqueur potentiel de la SLA. Ainsi, des patients clairement atteints de SLA et âgés de 40 à 70 ans, de même que des témoins en bonne santé, ont subi une IRM 3T en vertu d’une séquence conventionnelle. Dix-huit mois plus tard, dans les mêmes conditions, une deuxième IRM a été effectuée dans le cas des patients atteints de SLA. Résultats: La plupart de ces patients, soit 91,66 \% d’entre eux, ont donné à voir une forme de « ruban noir » dont la superficie moyenne atteignait 79,98 mm3. L’affaiblissement du potentiel nerveux a aussi permis de distinguer la SLA, la valeur moyenne, en unités arbitraires (UA), étant de 63,97 pour la section gauche du « ruban noir » (IC 95 \% : 60,67 - 67,27) et de 59,15 (IC 95 \% : 54,78 - 63,53) pour la section droite de ce même ruban. Une différence notable a été observée par rapport aux témoins, ces derniers donnant à voir une valeur moyenne de 107,85 (UA) (p {\textless} 0,001). Pour distinguer les patients atteints de SLA et les témoins, nous avons aussi déterminé que la limite optimale d’inclusion se situait à 83 (UA) (sensibilité : 0,92 ; spécificité : 0,93). Tant la capacité vitale forcée (CVF) que la force musculaire du membre supérieur controlatéral se sont révélées fortement corrélées à l’intensité du ruban associé à la SLA. Les patients ayant participé à une deuxième étude ont quant à eux présenté des modifications importantes en ce qui a trait à ce ruban en raison de l’évolution accélérée de leur maladie. Conclusions: Ce marqueur représente donc un outil précieux en vue de la sélection et du suivi de candidats devant participer à des essais cliniques.},

We examined the relationships between BMI at first clinical visit and changes in BMI up to a two-year follow-up, and multiple clinical variables related to ALS: age of onset, rate of progression of motor symptoms, and survival. Baseline BMI was classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Changes in BMI were classified as a loss of {\textgreater}1 unit, no change, or a gain of {\textgreater}1 unit. Our results showed that baseline BMI was not associated with age of onset, rate of progression or survival. In contrast, a loss of BMI {\textgreater}1 over two years was associated with significantly shorter survival and a faster rate of progression. In a multiple regression model, these results were independent of gender, site of onset, history of diabetes mellitus and apolipoprotein (ApoE) genotype. In summary, a change in BMI after ALS diagnosis was significantly associated with rate of progression and survival. This raises the possibility that early changes in BMI may identify patients likely to have a more malignant course of the disease.

The aim of this study was to identify whether and when historical changes in BMI occurred in ALS participants, how these longer term trajectories associated with survival, and whether metabolomic profiles provided insight into potential mechanisms. Methods: ALS and control participants self-reported body height and weight 10 (reference) and 5 years earlier, and at study entry (diagnosis for ALS participants). Generalized estimating equations evaluated differences in BMI trajectories between cases and controls. ALS survival was evaluated by BMI trajectory group using accelerated failure time models. BMI trajectories and survival associations were explored using published metabolomic profiling and correlation networks. Results: Ten-year BMI trends differed between ALS and controls, with BMI loss in the 5 years before diagnosis despite BMI gains 10 to 5 years beforehand in both groups. An overall 10-year drop in BMI associated with a 27.1\% decrease in ALS survival (P =.010). Metabolomic networks in ALS participants showed dysregulation in sphingomyelin, bile acid, and plasmalogen subpathways. Discussion: ALS participants lost weight in the 5-year period before enrollment. BMI trajectories had three distinct groups and the group with significant weight loss in the past 10 years had the worst survival. Participants with a high BMI and increase in weight in the 10 years before symptom onset also had shorter survival. Certain metabolomics profiles were associated with the BMI trajectories.

	abstract = {Body mass index (BMI) has various deficiencies as a measure of obesity, especially when the BMI measure is based on self-reported height and weight. BMI is an indirect measure of body fat compared with more direct approaches such as bioelectrical impedance. Moreover, BMI does not necessarily reflect the changes that occur with age. The proportion of body fat increases with age, whereas muscle mass decreases, but corresponding changes in height, weight and BMI may not reflect changes in body fat and muscle mass. Both the sensitivity and specificity of BMI have been shown to be poor. Additionally, the relation between BMI and percentage of body fat is not linear and differs for men and women. The consequences of the errors in the measurement of obesity with BMI depend on whether they are differential or nondifferential. Differential misclassification, a potentially greater problem in case-control and cross-sectional studies than in prospective cohort studies, can produce a bias toward or away from the null. Nondifferential misclassification produces a bias toward the null for a dichotomous exposure; for measures of exposure that are not dichotomous, the bias may be away from the null. In short, the use of BMI as a measure of obesity can introduce misclassification problems that may result in important bias in estimating the effects related to obesity.},

Our objective was to investigate past exposure to endogenous and synthetic steroids in female ALS patients and controls. Methods We administered a questionnaire to 158 postmenopausal women (75 ALS patients and 83 controls). We calculated reproductive time span (RTS), lifetime endogenous estrogen (LEE) and progesterone exposures (LPE), oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use, and reproductive history. Results ALS patients showed shorter LEE and LPE, a lower proportion of breast cancer, and 11\% showed no history of pregnancies vs. 4\% of controls. Odds ratios (ORs) showed that {\textless}17 y of LEE and a delayed menarche ({\textgreater}13 y) constitute risk factors for ALS [OR = 2.1 (95\% confidence interval CI, 1.08–4.2); and OR = 2.4 (95\% CI, 1.1–5.1) respectively]. According to Cox survival analysis, for each year the LEE increased over 17 y, it was independently associated with longer survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.37 (95\% CI, 0.16–0.85)] after adjusting for smoking, age and site of onset. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that for each month using OCP for longer than 40 mo increased the risk of ALS [adjusted OR = 4.1 (95\% CI, 1.2–13.8)]. Discussion Thus, longer exposure to endogenous female sex steroids increased survival and reduced ALS susceptibility. In contrast, longer exposure to synthetic sex steroids showed a negative impact by reducing the production of endogenous female sex steroids or due to crossover with other steroid receptors. Given the neuroprotective effects of sex steroids, we suggest that abnormalities of neuroendocrine components may alter motor function in women with ALS.},

It was conducted between October 3, 2020, and July 19, 2021.Participation in the NFL, including playing 1 or more professional games.Cases of ALS and death information were identified based on public records from NFL statistics aggregators, news reports, obituaries, and National Death Index results. The standardized incidence ratio and the standardized mortality ratio were calculated based on data acquired from surveillance studies of ALS accounting for age, sex, and race. Secondary analyses examined the association of body mass index, NFL career duration, race, birth location, and markers of fame, using a nested case-control design, matching athletes with ALS to athletes without ALS, by NFL debut year.A total of 19 423 male former and current NFL players (age range, 23-78 years) were included in this cohort study and were followed up for a cumulative 493 168 years (mean [SD] follow-up, 30.6 [13.7] years). Thirty-eight players received a diagnosis of ALS, and 28 died during the study time frame, representing a significantly higher incidence of ALS diagnosis (standardized incidence ratio, 3.59; 95\% CI, 2.58-4.93) and mortality (standardized mortality ratio, 3.94; 95\% CI, 2.62-5.69) among NFL players compared with the US male population, adjusting for age and race. Among NFL athletes, nested-case-control analyses found that those who received a diagnosis of ALS had significantly longer careers (mean [SD] duration, 7.0 [3.9] years) than athletes without ALS (mean [SD] duration, 4.5 [3.6] years; odds ratio, 1.2; 95\% CI, 1.1-1.3).

Athletes with a diagnosis of ALS had longer NFL careers than those without ALS, suggesting an association between NFL duration of play and ALS. The identification of these risk factors for ALS helps to inform the study of pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for this fatal neurodegenerative disease.},

Within the Clalit Health Services in Israel, we identified 948 ALS case patients from 2004 through 2017 and matched them with 1,000 control subjects each. Any statin use up to 3 years before ALS onset was not associated with ALS incidence but was associated with a reduced hazard ratio (HR) for death. Odds of ALS did not vary by statin potency, but use of only lower-potency statins was associated with longer survival (HR = 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.68, 0.98), whereas the association with higher-potency statins was null compared with those case patients who did not use statins.

	abstract = {Objective Metals have been suggested as a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but only retrospective studies are available to date. We compared metal levels in prospectively collected blood samples from ALS patients and controls, to explore whether metals are associated with ALS mortality. Methods A nested ALS case–control study was conducted within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort. Cases were identified through death certificates. We analyzed metal levels in erythrocyte samples obtained at recruitment, as a biomarker for metal exposure from any source. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, selenium, and zinc concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. To estimate ALS risk, we applied conditional logistic regression models. Results The study population comprised 107 cases (65\% female) and 319 controls matched for age, sex, and study center. Median time between blood collection and ALS death was 8 years (range = 1–15). Comparing the highest with the lowest tertile, cadmium (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–3.87) and lead (OR = 1.89, 95\% CI = 0.97–3.67) concentrations suggest associations with increased ALS risk. Zinc was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.50, 95\% CI = 0.27–0.94). Associations for cadmium and lead remained when limiting analyses to noncurrent smokers. Interpretation This is the first study to compare metal levels before disease onset, minimizing reverse causation. The observed associations suggest that cadmium, lead, and zinc may play a role in ALS etiology. Cadmium and lead possibly act as intermediates on the pathway from smoking to ALS.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To define patterns of spread through the order of lower motor neuron involvement (first, second or third order), relationships between interval or sites of affected areas from onset to involvement of a second region, and prognosis, including 5 year survival, normal preservation of motor function at onset of respiratory symptoms and cumulative occurrence of each region and direction of spread.
METHOD: 150 patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) underwent follow-up at 3 month intervals until the appearance of respiratory symptoms. Symptom appearances were determined using the revised version of the ALS Functional Rating Scale.
RESULT: Median survival with combined type onset (two regions simultaneously) was shorter (18 months) than with bulbar onset (26 months, p=0.01). The interval from onset to involvement of the second region correlated significantly with survival, independent of particular combinations. 5 year survival rate was 21\% for lower limb onset, 18\% for upper limb onset and 16\% for bulbar onset. No patient with a rapid spread pattern (two regions within 3\&emsp14;months from onset) survived {\textgreater}5 years. Early manifestations of bulbar symptoms within 1 year were associated with worse survival (p{\textless}0.001) although no significant difference in survival was seen between groups with and without bulbar symptoms (p=0.51). In terms of cumulative occurrence, symptoms spread longitudinally to adjacent regions. Bulbar function remained preserved in 27\%, lower limb function in 10\% and upper limb function in 2.7\%.
CONCLUSION: The interval between onset and involvement of the second region is an important predictor of survival. The data support the contiguous anatomical propagation of lower motor neuron involvement in sporadic ALS.},

	abstract = {Background:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder associated with loss of motor neurons. Our objective was to explore the epidemiology, clinical features, and survival factors of 1809 patients with ALS.

Methods:
We analyzed 1809 ALS patients, who were recruited from the Peking University Third Hospital from January 2005 to December 2015. Demographic data and disease-related parameters were collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival time. Cox proportional hazards function and the hazard ratio were used to identify adjusted prognostic predictors.

Results:
The results showed that the average annual incidence in Beijing alone was 0.38 cases/100,000 person-years and the mean age of onset was 48.88 ± 11.35 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 48.17–49.85) years. The median survival time from onset to death/tracheostomy was 58.89 ± 33.03 (95\% CI: 51.46–63.84) months. In the adjusted Cox proportional hazard model, age of onset, diagnosis delay, rate of disease progression (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised decline [points/month]), and body mass index all had an independent effect on survival in ALS.

Conclusions:
Our study provides information on epidemiology, clinical features, and survival factors of patients with ALS in China. These results can be helpful in clinical practice, clinical trial design, and validation of new tools to predict disease progression.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. As previous therapeutic trials in ALS have been severely hampered by patients’ heterogeneity, the identification of biomarkers that reliably reflect disease progression represents a priority in ALS research. Here, we used the D50 disease progression model to investigate correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels and disease aggressiveness. The D50 model quantifies individual disease trajectories for each ALS patient. The value D50 provides a unified measure of a patient’s overall disease aggressiveness (defined as time taken in months to lose 50\% of functionality). The relative D50 (rD50) reflects the individual disease covered and can be calculated for any time point in the disease course. We analyzed clinical data from a well-defined cohort of 156 patients with ALS. The concentration of NfL in CSF samples was measured at two different laboratories using the same procedure. Based on patients’ individual D50 values, we defined subgroups with high ({\textless}20), intermediate (20–40), or low ({\textgreater}40) disease aggressiveness. NfL levels were compared between these subgroups via analysis of covariance, using an array of confounding factors: age, gender, clinical phenotype, frontotemporal dementia, rD50-derived disease phase, and analyzing laboratory. We found highly significant differences in NfL concentrations between all three D50 subgroups (p {\textless} 0.001), representing an increase of NfL levels with increasing disease aggressiveness. The conducted analysis of covariance showed that this correlation was independent of gender, disease phenotype, and phase; however, age, analyzing laboratory, and dementia significantly influenced NfL concentration. We could show that CSF NfL is independent of patients’ disease covered at the time of sampling. The present study provides strong evidence for the potential of NfL to reflect disease aggressiveness in ALS and in addition proofed to remain at stable levels throughout the disease course. Implementation of CSF NfL as a potential read-out for future therapeutic trials in ALS is currently constrained by its demonstrated susceptibility to (pre-)analytical variations. Here we show that the D50 model enables the discovery of correlations between clinical characteristics and CSF analytes and can be recommended for future studies evaluating potential biomarkers.},

	abstract = {ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. However, patients show variability in the length of survival after symptom onset. Understanding the mechanisms of long survival could lead to possible avenues for therapy. This review surveys the reported length of survival in ALS, the clinical features that predict survival in individual patients, and possible factors, particularly genetic factors, that could cause short or long survival. The authors also speculate on possible mechanisms. a small number of known factors can explain some variability in ALS survival. However, other disease-modifying factors likely exist. Factors that alter motor neurone vulnerability and immune, metabolic, and muscle function could affect survival by modulating the disease process. Knowing these factors could lead to interventions to change the course of the disease. The authors suggest a broad approach is needed to quantify the proportion of variation survival attributable to genetic and non-genetic factors and to identify and estimate the effect size of specific factors. Studies of this nature could not only identify novel avenues for therapeutic research but also play an important role in clinical trial design and personalized medicine.},

	abstract = {Background and objective
Recent advances in the genetic causes of ALS reveals that about 10\% of ALS patients have a genetic origin and that more than 30 genes are likely to contribute to this disease. However, four genes are more frequently associated with ALS: C9ORF72, TARDBP, SOD1, and FUS. The relationship between genetic factors and ALS progression rate is not clear. In this study, we carried out a causal analysis of ALS disease with a genetics perspective in order to assess the contribution of the four mentioned genes to the progression rate of ALS.
Methods
In this work, we applied a novel causal learning model to the CRESLA dataset which is a longitudinal clinical dataset of ALS patients including genetic information of such patients. This study aims to discover the relationship between four mentioned genes and ALS progression rate from a causation perspective using machine learning and probabilistic methods.
Results
The results indicate a meaningful association between genetic factors and ALS progression rate with causality viewpoint. Our findings revealed that causal relationships between ALSFRS-R items associated with bulbar regions have the strongest association with genetic factors, especially C9ORF72; and other three genes have the greatest contribution to the respiratory ALSFRS-R items with a causation point of view.
Conclusions
The findings revealed that genetic factors have a significant causal effect on the rate of ALS progression. Since C9ORF72 patients have higher proportion compared to those carrying other three gene mutations in the CRESLA cohort, we need a large multi-centric study to better analyze SOD1, TARDBP and FUS contribution to the ALS clinical progression. We conclude that causal associations between ALSFRS-R clinical factors is a suitable predictor for designing a prognostic model of ALS.},
