\label{literature_review}

This chapter contains a review of literature on prognosis of motor neuron disease, looking at both prognostic factors from various data types, and also attempts to predict prognosis using machine learning.

\section{Clinical prognostic factors}

How can prognosis be measured? Survival, rate of progression, future ALSFRS-R, future need for therapies, composite end point of NIV, tracheostomy, and death.

\subsection{Non-genetic}

A large meta-analysis in 2021 collated research studies on non-genetic prognostic factors in ALS associated with survival risk~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
The review calculated and reported the hazard ratios (HRs) for each factor which had at least 3 studies reporting on it. Heterogeniety was assessed using the I-squared statistic, and sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results.
None of the sensitivity analyses showed a significant change in the results, and the authors concluded that the results were robust.

Starting with demographic factors, the meta-analysis found a higher age of symptom onset is associated with a higher risk of death (HR = 1.03)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}. However, age of onset is an imprecise measure because it is diffiuclt for patients to pinpoint their exact date of symptom onset, since symptoms often arise gradually.
It is common in clinical records for the onset date to be the first date of the month or even the first day of the year if the patient is having trouble remembering. Nevertheless, the harmful effect of older age at onset is consistent with much of literature (FIND CITATIONS HERE).
The meta-analysis also found that single, as opposed to married, patients have a worse prognosis (HR = 1.73), and that being a current smoker (HR=1.37) or a former smoker (HR=1.16) are both negative prognostic factors~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.

Rapid weight loss is a common feature of MND because of difficulties eating and swallowing, decreased appetite, and loss of muscle mass. A higher body-mass index (BMI) at diagnosis is associated with a lower risk of death (HR = 0.97) from 17 different studies in the meta-analysis ~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
Another smaller meta-analysis specifically on BMI also found that higher BMI at baseline is protective HR=0.96)~\cite{dardiotisBodyMassIndex2018}, also backed up by a large population study of 1,809 patients from China (BMI >= 25 kg/m2, HR=0.36)~\cite{gaoEpidemiologyFactorsPredicting2021}.
However, there are some studies that have found no association between baseline BMI and survival, rather that the most important BMI prognostic factor is the rate of change in BMI~\cite{jawaidDecreaseBodyMass2010}.
Specifically, a decrease in BMI both 5 years and 10 years before symptom onset has been associated with shorter survival, in a study of N=381 ALS patients~\cite{goutmanBodyMassIndex2023}.
Since BMI is a simplistic measure that fails to capture body composition~\cite{rothmanBMIrelatedErrorsMeasurement2008}, Lindauer and colleagues used MRI of the knees and diaphragm to measure levels of subcutaneous and visceral fat in 62 ALS patients.
They found that higher subcutaneous fat is associated with higher ALSFRS-R and lower rate of ALSFRS-R decrease~\cite{lindauerAdiposeTissueDistribution2013}. Visceral fat was not associated with either measures.

The appearance of cognitive and behavioural impairment can also have an impact on survival.
Executive dysfunction, the inability to manage cognitive tasks, is associated with fast disease progression~\cite{elaminExecutiveDysfunctionNegative2011} and shorter survival in the meta-analysis (HR=2.1)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
Moreover, the meta-analysis found that the presence of FTD (HR=2.98) and non-specific dementia (HR=1.41) are both associated with shorter survival~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.

The El Escorial criteria are used to diagnose ALS, and a patient being assigned to the "probable" category as opposed to the "definite" category is associated with longer survival (HR=0.73), and "possible" is associated with even longer survival (HR=0.60)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
Definite ALS patients progressing faster also found in a large multi-centre study~\cite{westenengPrognosisPatientsAmyotrophic2018}. However, in the large Chinese cohort of 1,809 patients, there was no significant relationshop between El Escorial and survival~\cite{gaoEpidemiologyFactorsPredicting2021}.

The meta-analysis also considered the association of survival with site of onset, where motor symptoms first appear.
In comparison with spinal onset, which is the most typical ALS onset site, both respiratory onset (HR=2.2) and bulbar onset (HR=1.35), meaning the first symptoms are in the mouth and throat, are associated with shorter survival~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
The onset sites that are protective compared to spinal onset are flail arm or leg onset (HR=0.61) and predominantly upper or lower motor neuron (pUMN or pLMN) (HR=0.32).
The speed of progression of the disease is also a prognostic factor. Fujimura-Kiyono and colleagues found that, in a cohort of 150 sporadic ALS patients, a shorter interval between the first motor onset and the next site involvement is associated with shorter survival, independent of what those onset sites are~\cite{fujimura-kiyonoOnsetSpreadingPatterns2011a}.

A higher ALSFRS-R at baseline is associated with longer survival (HR=0.96), and a higher rate of decline in ALSFRS-R from onset to diagnosis is associated with shorter survival (HR=1.48 for categorical, HR=2.37 continuous)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
The rate of decline in ALSFRS-R from onset to diagnosis is also called the progression rate to baseline, or PRB, and is calculated as
\begin{equation}
    PRB = \frac{48-\textnormal{ALSFRS-R}(t_{diag})}{t_{diag}-t_{onset}},
\end{equation}\label{eq:PRB}
where $t_{diag}$ and $t_{onset}$ are the dates of MND diagnosis and symptom onset respectively, and 48 is the maximum score of ALSFRS-R.

Other clinical factors associated with shorter survival are lower forced vital capacity (FVC), and a shorter time between symptom onset and diagnosis~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
When the diagnostic delay is longer than one year, Su and colleagues found it to be associated with longer survival in their meta-analysis (HR=0.39)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}, and results from the large Chinese cohort agree that an onset shorter than one year is harmful to survival risk (HR=3.43).
This is probably because the longer the delay, the more likely it is that the patient has a slowly progressing form of MND that is not obviously ALS in diagnostic tests.

Statins, a drug used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, has also been investigated as a prognostic factor in MND.
Su and colleagues found that taking or not taking statins has no significant effect on survival, based on 3 papers that all reported non-significant HRs~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.
However, a study published after the meta-analysis looked not only at statin use but also at the dose of statins and the duration of statin use.
Weisskopf and colleagues found that, in a cohort of 948 ALS patients, taking statins for under 3 years is protective for survival (HR=0.77), but that there is no significant protection or harm when the duration of statin use is over 3 years~\cite{weisskopfStatinMedicationsAmyotrophic2022}.
Additionally, they found that taking low-potency statins compared to not taking any statins is protective for survival (HR=0.82), but they found no signficant effects with higher-dose statins.
They concluded that the statins may have a protective effect on ALS survival, if the underlying reasons for taking statins do not necessitate high dose and long duration of use, which would imply a more severe cardiovascular condition that may be harmful to survival.

Finally, the meta-analysis found that taking Riluzole is associated with longer survival (HR=0.80)~\cite{suPredictorsSurvivalPatients2021}.

\subsection{Genetic}

Genetic testing after diagnosis is becoming more common now that the extent of the genetic contribution to MND is better understood and that therapeutics are being developed to target specific genetic mutations~\cite{efnstaskforceondiagnosisandmanagementofamyotrophiclateralsclerosis:EFNSGuidelinesClinical2012}.
Increased data availability of genetic markers has led to a number of studies on the prognostic value of genetic markers in MND.
A network meta-analysis on genetic factors associated with survival in ALS found that the C9orf72 repeat expansion is associated with shorter survival compared to no known variants (HR=1.6)~\cite{suGeneticFactorsSurvival2022}.
This is consistent with another study of cohort of 1,245 ALS patients that found that, in a multivariable Cox regression model, the C9orf72 repeat expansion is associated with shorter survival (HR=1.65)~\cite{chioAssociationCopresencePathogenic2023}.
Also associated with shorter survival is ATXN2, a CAG repeat expansion usually associated with spinal onset ALS (HR=3.6), and a mutated FUS (fused in sarcoma) (HR=1.8)~\cite{suGeneticFactorsSurvival2022}.

\subsection{Tools for Prognosis}

There are limited clinical tools for prognosis prediction in MND. The most common way for progression to be assessed is through the progression rate in Equation~\ref{eq:PRB}, which can be generalised to the progression rate to any time point, not just diagnosis.
Extrapolating this progression rate to predict future ALSFRS-R scores is a common way to predict future progression, called the "pre-slope model", but it is not a perfect method since it assumes that ALSFRS-R decline is linear.

To overcome these issues, the D50 model was developed, which fits a sigmoidal curve to a patient's ALSFRS-R timepoints, yielding an individualised prediction of future ALSFRS-R scores
~\cite{poesenNeurofilamentMarkersALS2017, steinbachApplyingD50Disease2020}.
The D50 model can provide a measure of disease aggressiveness, which is the estimated rate of functional loss from the sigmoidal curve, and disease accummulation, which is the patient's position on the D50 curve independent of time.

A non-linear extension of the D50 model was proposed by Ramamoorthy and colleagues, where Gaussian processes are used to non-parametrically cluster patients into non-linear ALSFRS-R trajectories~\cite{ramamoorthyIdentifyingPatternsAmyotrophic2022}.
In their model development, they found that many of the patients in their cohort had non-linear ALSFRS-R trajectories (convex, concave, sigmoidal) and that the slope of ALSFRS-R in the first year of the disease is not sufficient to accurately predict future ALSFRS-R scores.

Finally, a popular model for predicting survival probability in ALS is the ENCALS model~\cite{westenengPrognosisPatientsAmyotrophic2018}.
Using data from 14 European ALS centres and over 11,000 patient records, Westeneng and colleagues developed a multivariable Royston-Parmar model to predict a survival probability function for an individual ALS patient from baseline information.
They selected the predictors through backward elimination and bootstapping, and predictors present in more than 70\% of the bootstrapped models were included in the final model.
The harmful predictors included in the final model are bulbar onset (HR=1.71), age of onset (HR=1.03), El Escorial definite ALS (HR=1.47), higher PRB (HR=6.33), presence of FTD (HR=1.34), and C9orf72 repeat expansion (HR=1.45).
The protective predictors are a longer diagnostic delay (HR=0.52) and a higher FVC (HR=0.99).

The ENCALS model is available by request of medical doctors, and was validated using a leave-one-site-out protocol.
The authors demonstrated the model's ability to predict survival by using data from Stephen Hawking, a famous physicist who lived with ALS for a startling 55 years after diagnosis, and found that the model predicted his survival probability well.
The predicted probability of surviving over 10 years was 94\% and the interquartile range of predicted year of death was 1981 to 2011, which is consistent with the year of Stephen Hawking's tracheostomy in 1985 (which is the endpoint of the model's prediction: NIV for more than 23 hours a day, tracheostomy, or death).




\section{Imaging prognostic factors}

Structural MRI of the brain is often conducted as part of the differential diagnosis of MND, in order to rule out mimic diseases.
Imaging is not used for prognosis and progression monitoring clinically because, as the disease progresses, it becomes difficult and uncomfortable for the patient to lie still in the MRI scanner, and the MRI signal is sensitive to motion artefacts.
Therefore, the majority of imaging studies in MND are cross-sectional, and the number of longitudinal studies is limited.
However, there have been a number of studies that have found associations between baseline imaging measures and prognosis in MND.

A critical review of imaging studies in ALS up to 2014 found that some of the most consistent limitations affecting these studies were small sample sizes and poor patient characterisation, meaning that information on clinical phenotypes and genetic status was often missing, which could have affected the significance of results~\cite{bedeLessonsALSImaging2014}.
Especially noted was the inconsistency that is common in ALS imaging studies, where the same imaging measure is found to be both increased and decreased in different studies.
However, some consistent findings have emerged, such as the finding that the corticospinal tract (CST) is affected in ALS, and that the motor cortex is affected in ALS, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of the disease.

Prognosis is studied in ALS by looking at the relationship between imaging measures and clinical measures of progression.
These measures of progression include ALSFRS-R, the rate of decline in ALSFRS-R, and survival time (comparing short and long survivors, for example).
Although, correlating imaging measures with ALSFRS-R and extracting prognostic meaning is not an ideal methodology because the ALSFRS-R is a measure dominated by the effects of lower motor neuron degeneration, which is not well captured in brain MRI~\cite{bedeLessonsALSImaging2014}.

\subsection{Neuroimaging}

In this section, we are explore brain regions implicated in MND prognosis, grouped by their location in the brain.
However, some studies have focused on overall brain structure differences by totalling the volume of all grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) in the brain, and found that lower total baseline GM volume is associated with faster progression (N=29)~\cite{elmendiliAssociationBrainUpper2023}.
When the GM was parcellated further, the only discriminating factor in ROC analysis between fast and slow progressors was the cortical GM volume.
This is consistent with a study of 32 ALS patients who underwent multimodal MRI at three time points, where the authors concluded that changes to WM generally occur before diagnosis, making them a potential biomarker for early diagnosis, and that GM changes occur after diagnosis, making them a potential biomarker for prognosis~\cite{bedeLongitudinalStructuralChanges2018}.
Other studies have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure the microstructure of the brain, and looked at the the resulting metrics averaged over the whole brain.
The main DTI measures are fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD).
Lower overall FA has been associated with faster progression in a study of 67 patients~\cite{sendaStructuralMRICorrelates2017} and 6 patients~\cite{baldaranovLongitudinalDiffusionTensor2017}.
However, Trojsi and colleagues found no differences in GM or WM damage between fast and slow progressors, both measured by structural MRI and by DTI metrics (N=54)~\cite{trojsiRestingStateFunctional2021}.
In their study, the only difference between fast and slow progressors was in functional connectivity, where fast progressors had decreased functional connectivity in the motor and extra-motor networks, and increase functional connectivity in the salience network.
This inconsistency of findings is common in ALS imaging studies, and is likely due to the small sample sizes and the inconsistency of progression measures used in the studies.

MND is characterised by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration, so changes in the motor cortex and the corticospinal tract (CST) are expected to be affected by the disease.
Particularly in the motor cortex, the motor band sign has been implicated in affecting prognosis, and the motor band sign is a signal attenuation or hypointensity in the shape of a ribbon at the posterior border of the precentral gyrus, which is seen on T2-weighted MRI and also on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)~\cite{bollHypointensityMotorCortex2019}.
Motor band sign intensity was found to be a predictor of shorter survival in a study of 73 ALS patients (HR=2.97)~\cite{rizzoDiagnosticPrognosticValue2020}, and the difference in motor band sign intensity after 18-month followup was significantly correlated with ALSFRS-R disease progression, but only in a study of 7 patients~\cite{bollHypointensityMotorCortex2019}.

One of the most studied area of the brain in ALS is the CST, which is the main motor pathway in the brain, connecting the motor cortex to the spinal cord.
Most studies have found that higher FA in the CST is a protective factor in prognosis.
Associating these DTI metrics with ALSFRS-R, higher FA in the CST has been associated with higher baseline ALSFRS-R, both bilaterally in a large study (N=253)~\cite{mullerLargescaleMulticentreCerebral2016} and only on the left side in a study of 33 patients~\cite{liBrainstemInvolvementAmyotrophic2021}.
Lower average CST FA has been significantly correlated with higher progression rate in a study of 24 patients~\cite{agostaMRIPredictorsLongterm2010}, and lower FA and higher RD in both the left and right CSTs has been associated with PRB in a study of 60 patients~\cite{menkeWidespreadGreyMatter2014}.
A faster rate of FA decline in CST has also been associated with faster ALSFRS-R decline in the first 8 months post-diagnosis (N=66)~\cite{kalraProspectiveHarmonizedMulticenter2020}.
Finally, higher FA in the left CST has been associated with longer survival (HR=0.97) in a study of 24 patients~\cite{agostaMRIPredictorsLongterm2010}.

White matter tracts other than the CST have also been found to be associated with prognosis in MND, and Burgh and colleagues described widespread loss of white matter integrity being characteristic of ALS (N=292)~\cite{burghMultimodalLongitudinalStudy2020}.
Similar to the CST, high FA has been found to be a protective factor in prognosis in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (as well as low MD, N=41)~\cite{grolezMRICervicalSpinal2018} and in the right superior longitudinal fascicle (as well as low RD, N=60)~\cite{menkeWidespreadGreyMatter2014}.
When disease aggressivness has been estimated by the D50 model, studies have found that higher disease aggressiveness is associated with cerebral white matter density decreases in tracts connecting the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes (N=85)~\cite{steinbachApplyingD50Disease2020}, and with MD and AD elevations in the fronto-parietal tract (N=145)~\cite{steinbachDiseaseAggressivenessSignatures2021}.

Cortical thickness (CT) is another measure of brain structure that has been associated with prognosis in MND, and is the distance between the pial surface and the grey-white matter boundary, and is often measured using T1-weighted MRI.
CT loss has been associated with faster progression in MND, in the temporal lobe (N=20, N=45)~\cite{dambrosioFrontotemporalCorticalThinning2014, verstraeteStructuralMRIReveals2012} and in the frontal lobe (N=45)~\cite{verstraeteStructuralMRIReveals2012}.
However, when considering a measure of disease aggressiveness estimated from the D50 model, Dieckmann and colleagues found no association with CT volumes at baseline in a cohort of 100 ALS patients~\cite{dieckmannCorticalSubcorticalGrey2022}.
A caveat to that finding is that they did not include any patients with cognitive deficits, so the results may not be generalisable to the whole ALS population since cognitive deficits are common in ALS.
An interesting finding from Burgh and colleagues (N=292) found that longer survivors had widespread cortical thinning at diagnosis, but this stayed constant over time, whereas short survivors had less CT thinning at diagnosis, but then more extensive changes to CT over time (N=292)~\cite{burghMultimodalLongitudinalStudy2020}.

Subcortical structures in the brain that have been associated with ALS prognosis are the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and the amygdala.
Atrophy in the thalamus has been associated with faster decline of ALSFRS-R (N=67)~\cite{sendaStructuralMRICorrelates2017}, and right thalamus volume was the only subcortical brain region with significant association with disease aggressivness from D50 model (N=100)~\cite{dieckmannCorticalSubcorticalGrey2022}.
Additionally, texture analysis metrics from SWI in the left thalamus were significantly correlated with progression rate (N=17)~\cite{johnsQuantifyingChangesSusceptibility2019}.

In the basal ganglia, GM atrophy in the left caudate and right putamen (N=17)~\cite{agostaLongitudinalAssessmentGrey2009} and the caudate nucleus (N=67)~\cite{sendaStructuralMRICorrelates2017} have been associated with faster progression.
Shorter survival in a cohort of 112 ALS patients has been associated with an overall smaller basal ganglia and a smaller amygdala at baseline in a Cox model~\cite{westenengSubcorticalStructuresAmyotrophic2015}. However, when adjusted for age of onset, these significances were lost.
Finally, in a cohort of 157 patients, Ishaque and colleagues found significant texture changes, derived from texture analysis on DTI, in the basal ganglia and hippocampus of short surviving patients, but not in longer surviving patients~\cite{ishaqueEvaluatingCerebralCorrelates2018}.
The longer surviving patients had texture changes restricted to motor regions.

Further studies have looked at the hippocampus with mixed results.
A smaller hippocampus was associated with shorter survival in the Cox model of 112 patients~\cite{westenengSubcorticalStructuresAmyotrophic2015}, but this significance was lost when adjusted for age of onset, as with the basal ganglia and amygdala.
Abdulla and colleagues found no correlation between hippocampal volume and ALSFRS-R or rate of decline in ALSFRS-R (N=58)~\cite{abdullaHippocampalDegenerationPatients2014}, and Muller and colleagues found no correlation between hippocampal FA and ALSFRS-R (N=253)~\cite{mullerLargescaleMulticentreCerebral2016}.
Dieckmann and colleagues found that decreased bilateral hippocampal volume was associated with disease accumulation, but not disease aggressiveness, in a cohort of 100 ALS patients~\cite{dieckmannCorticalSubcorticalGrey2022}.
Progression rates significantly negatively correlated with local shape distances in the right hippocampus in a cohort of 32 ALS patinets, meaning that the more the shape of the right hippocampus deviates from the average shape, the faster the progression rate~\cite{taeShapeAnalysisSubcortical2020}.
Finally, Stoppel and colleagues found that increased hippocampal activation in resting-state fMRI was associated with lower ALSFRS-R, meaning a more advanced disease (N=14)~\cite{stoppelStructuralFunctionalHallmarks2014}.

Since ALS is closely related to FTD, the frontal lobe and fronto-temporal lobe have been studied in relation to prognosis in MND.
GM atrophy in the frontotemporal lobe has been associated with medium and fast progression in a study of 67 patients, and this was not seen in slow-progressing patients~\cite{sendaStructuralMRICorrelates2017}.
Additionally, decreased FA in the frontotemporal lobe has been associated with rapid progression in the same study~\cite{sendaStructuralMRICorrelates2017}.
This result was also found in the frontol lobe, where a faster decline in FA was associated with faster decline in ALSFRS-R in a study of 66 patients~\cite{kalraProspectiveHarmonizedMulticenter2020}.
However, Muller and colleagues found no correlation between frontol areas FA and ALSFRS-R (N=253)~\cite{mullerLargescaleMulticentreCerebral2016}.
Finally, fast progressors have decreased functional connectivity in middle frontal gyri and paracentral lobule (N=45)~\cite{trojsiRestingStateFunctional2021}, and ALSFRS-R correlated with reduced connectivity in left sensorimotor cortex (N=26)~\cite{agostaSensorimotorFunctionalConnectivity2011}.

Ventricles are enlarged when the brain atrophies, and larger ventricular volume has been associated with lower baseline ALSFRS-R in a study of 112 patients~\cite{westenengSubcorticalStructuresAmyotrophic2015}.

The brain stem is another area of the brain with mixed results in relation to prognosis in MND.
Since the brain stem is involed in the regulation of breathing, and the most common cause of death in MND is respiratory failure, it is expected that the brain stem would be a candidate prognostic marker in MND.
Baseline medulla oblongata volume significantly predicted short versus long survival in a cohort of 60 ALS patients~\cite{milellaMedullaOblongataVolume2022}.
However, Steinbach and colleagues found that brain stem GM density has no affect on aggressivess disease from D50~\cite{steinbachApplyingD50Disease2020}, and no correlation between brain stem FA and ALSFRS-R was found in a study of 253 patients~\cite{mullerLargescaleMulticentreCerebral2016}.

Finally, brain age has been associated with prognosis in MND. Brain age is a measure of how much the brain has aged compared to the average brain of the same chronological age, and is calculated using machine learning models trained on healthy brain MRI data.
An increased brain age, meaning the brain looks older than it should, has been associated with faster progression in a study of 112 patients~\cite{hermannCognitiveBehaviouralNot2022}.
Interestingly, significant brain age changes were only found in ALS patients with cognitive and behavioural impairment, and not in those without. This could signify that obvious brain changes are only seen in patients with cognitive and behavioural impairment, and that the brain changes in patients without cognitive and behavioural impairment are more subtle.
Many of the imaging studies discussed in this section either did not include patients with cognitive and behavioural impairment, or did not report on the presence of cognitive and behavioural impairment, so this could be a confounding factor in the results of these studies.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a technique that can be used to measure the concentration of metabolites in the brain, and has been used to study prognosis in MND.
The N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to choline (Cho) ratio is a measure of neuronal health, and lower NAA/Cho in the primary motor cortex has been associated with shorter survival in a Cox hazard survival analysis of 63 patients~\cite{kalraCerebralDegenerationPredicts2006}.
Even when ALSFRS-R and FVC were included in the model, NAA/Cho was the significant predictor of survival (HR=0.14).

In summary, advanced imaging studies provide valuable insights into the diverse structural and functional associations of MND prognosis.
While findings highlight the involvement of various brain regions and white matter tracts, including the corticospinal tract and subcortical structures, challenges such as inconsistent results and confounding factors show the importance of analysing imaging data with better patient characterisation, through clinical data.
