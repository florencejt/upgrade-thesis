\section{Motor Neuron Disease}

MND general knowledge: what is it, survival times, diagnostic delays, PLS/PMA/ALS etc

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is MND?
    \item What are the different types of MND?
    \item What are the symptoms of MND?
    \item What are the causes of MND?
    \item What are the treatments for MND?
    \item What is the prognosis for MND?
    \item What is the epidemiology of MND?
    \item How is it diagnosed? Ruling out ALS mimics, El Escorial scale, imaging to rule out other conditions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prognostic factors in MND}

\subsubsection{Clinical Data}

Types of clinical data: questionnaires for motor and cognitive changes, demographics, etc

How are the clinical data used? Clinical trials, diagnosis, progression monitoring

\subsubsection{Imaging Data}

What is imaging data used for? Ruling out mimic diseases

\subsubsubsection{Neuroimaging}

Structural, DTI, fMRI

\subsubsubsection{Spinal Cord Imaging}


\subsubsubsection{Muscle Imaging}


\subsubsection{Genetics}


\subsubsection{Fluid Biomarkers}



\section{Machine Learning}

Link to previous section: we know a lot of prognostic factors in MND, could tools be developed for clinicans to use these factors to automate or improve clinical decisions like diagnosis and prognosis?

\subsection{Introduction to Machine Learning}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is machine learning?
    \item How is it different to statistics?
    \item What are the different types of machine learning?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Supervised learning
        \item Unsupervised learning
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine Learning in MND}

\subsubsection{With clinical data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Classical machine learning models
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random Forest
        \item Support Vector Machines
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deep learning models with clinical data
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examples of studies that use deep learning with ALS
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{With imaging data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Examples of studies that use imaging with ALS
    \item Brain MRI
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Structural MRI
        \item Diffusion MRI
    \end{itemize}
    \item Spinal cord MRI
    \item Muscle MRI/ultrasound
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{With multimodal data}

The papers that use multimodal data and machine learning for MND

\begin{itemize}
    \item Neurodegenerative diseases are multifactorial and sometimes obscure
    \item Data fusion can help us understand them and the underlying mechanisms
    \item What about using both clinical and imaging data?
    \item This is known as multimodal data fusion methods
    \item Only done a few times in MND
\end{itemize}
